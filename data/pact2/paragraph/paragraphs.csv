At the Government's initiative, planning committees were formed at the national and local levels.

UNMIBH_S/2000/1137;18;5371;The past months have also witnessed a dramatic increase in the number of women victims of trafficking seeking UNMIBH assistance. Since March 1999, UNMIBH has assisted 364 such victims, mostly from Moldova, Romania and Ukraine. Of these, 216 requested and qualified for repatriation with the assistance of the International Organization for Migration (IOM)., 80 of these cases have arisen since June 2000. As more police raids are conducted on nightclubs and bars suspected of being run by traffickers, the number of known victims is expected to increase. It is of deep concern that, owing to lack of funding, IOM is substantially reducing its operations in this vital humanitarian area. Without the possibility of temporary shelter and repatriation, victims of trafficking are put at even greater risk following their release from local police custody.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;Implement;

UNMIBH_S/1999/989;28;5304;"UNMIBH and the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights continue to oversee and coordinate investigations into allegations regarding the trafficking of foreign women. On 11 July, 20 women were arrested in police raids on cafe bars in canton 6 (Busovaca, Vitez and Novi Travnik) and were subsequently convicted of violating laws of the defunct ""Herceg-Bosna"", which UNMIBH considers to be invalid. The Special Representative has written to cantonal and Federation officials demanding that any deportation proceedings be suspended until further notice. In the Republika Srpska, a cafe bar owner in Brcko was convicted and sentenced to three years’ imprisonment for procuring persons for prostitution.

exacerbate political tensions. This activity has been of special importance

UNPREDEP_S/1997/365;4;3301;"4. In addition to the community and border patrols carried out by the civilian
police and the military observers, UNPREDEP military personnel conducted more
than 190 patrols a week during the reporting period [BorderControl: Monitor, Implement, Operations_PatrolsInterventions: Implement]. On average, UNPREDEP
observes approximately 90 patrols per week by the armed forces of Albania, the
Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and the host country. However, during the month
of March 1997, the number of those patrols increased to more than 160 per week.
Furthermore, UNPREDEP reports that military units of the Federal Republic of
Yugoslavia and those of the host country now actively patrol their territory up
to the old administrative border of the former Socialist Federal Republic of
Yugoslavia [Operations_PatrolsInterventions, BorderControl: Monitor]. It is the view of UNPREDEP that those patrols are closely linked to
the process of demarcating the border between the two countries. The new
pattern of patrolling has increased the frequency of encounters with UNPREDEP
patrols operating in those areas and has been a source of concern to the Force
Commander. Following consultations, both sides have reaffirmed their intention
to respect the understanding on the United Nations patrol line, which was
negotiated to facilitate UNPREDEP patrolling based on visible and manageable key
terrain features rather than on the old administrative border.

UNPREDEP_S/1996/961;23;3299;"23. As I stated in my report to the Council of 23 May 1996 (S/1996/373), I
believe that at this time of financial crisis UNPREDEP, like all peacekeeping
operations, must be rigorously evaluated in order to determine if its mandate is
still relevant in the present context and, if so, whether it can be implemented
with fewer resources. As pointed out in paragraph 43 of that report, the issue
at stake is whether the current volume of patrolling [Opearations_PatrolsInterventions: Implement] and the current number of
observation posts are absolutely necessary [BorderControl: Monitor].";;;;;;;;;;;;Implement;;;;;Monitor;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
UNPREDEP_S/1996/961;22;3298;"22. As I had the opportunity to note in my most recent report to the Council
(S/1996/819), peace and stability in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia
are intimately linked to the overall situation in the region. While much
progress has been achieved there since the signing of the Dayton Agreement, it
is clear that the international community’s political and military involvement
in the former Yugoslavia will of necessity continue for some time in order to
consolidate peace and security. The original purpose of deploying a preventive
United Nations mission in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia was to
prevent conflicts elsewhere in the former Yugoslavia from spilling over or
threatening that country. Recent developments in the region, and the enhanced
international standing of the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, have made
such a scenario more remote. Moreover, as noted above, it has become
increasingly evident that the primary threat to the country’s stability may come
from internal political tensions. UNPREDEP has accordingly devoted considerable
attention to strengthening dialogue between the political forces and has
assisted in monitoring human rights and inter-ethnic relations [HumanRights: Monitor].";;;;;;;Monitor;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
UNPREDEP_S/1996/961;8;3297;"8. Humanitarian assistance to the local population, especially on the part of
the national battalions, has also been an important contribution, examples of
which have been cited in my earlier reports [HumanitarianRelief: Assist]. The commitment of the mission’s
staff, both civilian and military, as well as external donors’ trust in their
work, have made it possible to initiate small but effective programmes which
have complemented UNPREDEP’s main mandate of preventive deployment and good
offices. These have had important results in building confidence between the
people of the host country and the mission. They have also paved the way for
any successor arrangements that may be put in place once the preventive
deployment operation in the country comes to an end.

stability of the country are certainly much less than they were when I
recommended a preventive deployment in November 1992. However, it is too soon
to be confident that stability has been established in the region. Full
implementation of the General Framework Agreement for Peace in Bosnia and
Herzegovina is far from being assured., the former Yugoslav Republic of
Macedonia’s border with the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, where much of the
UNPREDEP patrolling takes place [BorderControl: Monitor, Implement, Operations_PatrolsInterventions: Implement], has yet to be demarcated., the dispute between

between two options concerning their location. Under the first option the
military observers would live within daily driving distance of the border areas.
Even assuming increased helicopter support and good weather conditions, the
efficiency of the observers would be only 25 to 30 per cent of that of the
infantry units that currently live at the observation posts. However, inclement
weather prevails during eight months of the year, which means that observation
posts are accessible only with tracked vehicles and helicopters. During the
winter, many posts cannot be reached at all because of snow, ice and/or fog.
Soldiers endure these conditions and continue their patrolling activities [Operations_PatrolsInterventions: Implement],
except when their safety is at risk. United Nations military observers, on the
other hand, would have to allow for the time needed to travel between their
accommodations and the observation posts, as well as coping with the severe
weather conditions at the border. As a result, patrolling by military observers
would be extremely taxing and would be restricted to a few daylight hours per

the right mix of soldiers in the right locations and by patrolling [Operations_PatrolsInterventions: Implement] areas within
its theatre with maximum vigilance and efficiency. The alternative of
entrusting these tasks exclusively to United Nations military observers has to
be judged on the basis of whether it would be capable of maintaining the current
high level of surveillance of the borders. My military advisers estimate that a
minimum of 250 observers would be required to replace the two infantry
battalions and that even this number would be a poor substitute for the accurate
reporting system now provided by the two infantry battalions.";;;;;;;;;;;;Implement;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

posters, flags and wall paintings have proceeded smoothly, although there have
been reports of incidents in which activists have destroyed or pasted over a
political party’s mural propaganda. Thus far, none of these incidents has been
serious. All the parties are being granted access to the media, although the
frequency of access and the extent of coverage depend on the medium concerned.
As to the content of the publicity, the Electoral Division of ONUSAL has
received a number of complaints regarding the use of public resources to promote
indirectly the party of the Government in power. In addition, the Electoral
Division itself, in monitoring the media, has noticed two pieces of televised
publicity by the ARENA party containing elements that may violate article 18 of
the electoral propaganda rules [ElectionAssistance, PartyAssistance, Media: Monitor]. That article provides that no party shall
include in its publicity emblems and insignia used by other parties.

ONUSAL_S/26581_Annex;52;3267;"Following is a detailed evaluation of the state of implementation of the
recommendations of the ONUSAL Human Rights Division [HumanRights: Monitor]:
(a) Ratification or adherence to international human rights instruments, including the conventions of the International Labour Organisation (ILO) [HumanRights: Monitor]. The Government has expressed its willingness to ratify or adhere to human rights conventions in the near future, with the exception of the one recognizing the compulsory jurisdiction of the Inter-American Court of Human Rights. With
regard to the ILO conventions, the Government has indicated that they will be processed within the framework of the consultations being carried out in the Forum for Economic and Social Consultation.,

(b) Structural and functional reform of the judiciary [JusticeReform: Monitor]. Although implementation implies constitutional reforms, some policy-setting reforms are
being effected in that direction, of which some have already been approved by the Legislative Assembly and others are being debated within the judicial community (see also sect. III A 6).,

(c) Establishment of a special commission of inquiry to investigate arbitrary executions [TransitionalJustice: Monitor]. While the Government has expressed its willingness to
give priority to the investigation of those cases indicated by ONUSAL and NGOs as possible arbitrary executions, it has stated the impossibility of creating a special commission, given the fact that such an investigative mechanism is not provided for in the country’s institutional structure. It has therefore been
agreed to address the substance of the recommendation by establishing a mechanism of investigation of those cases which, in the opinion of ONUSAL, warrant it.,

(d) Measures to make habeas corpus and amparo effective and accessible [LegalReform: Monitor]. The Government has submitted for national debate a draft law amending the
legislation on habeas corpus. In general terms, the draft represents a positive step, although it could be expanded to offer more effective protection. A regulation that would fully guarantee habeas corpus would imply constitutional reforms to guarantee wide access by those affected to the jurisdictional organ that is currently limited to the Constitutional Hall of the Supreme Court. Implementation of the recommendation on amparo is pending, as no proposals have
as yet been made.,

(e) Compensation fund for victims [TransitionalJustice: Monitor]. The Government is now carrying out a preliminary evaluation of this recommendation, which includes a study of the various ways of establishing the Fund (see also sect. IV below). The non-governmental Human Rights Commission of El Salvador has prepared a draft law for the creation for a special fund for reparation and national reconciliation, which it has submitted to the Legislative Assembly. The draft contains
constructive elements that should be taken into account in the recommendation’s implementation.,

(f) Improvement of the composition and powers of the National Council of the Judiciary and independence of the Judicial Training School [JusticeReform: Monitor]. This recommendation implies amendments to the National Council of the Judiciary Act and to the Constitution. The procedure for its implementation is yet to be
initiated.,

(g) Elimination of extrajudicial confession. The new Ley de Defensoria Publica and the changes in the Procedural Criminal Code and the Basic Law of the Public Ministry in relation to the control of the defence of the accused has resulted in a lessening of the incidence of extrajudicial confessions [LegalReform: Monitor]. The Ministry of Justice has also prepared a draft law specifically on the
invalidation of extrajudicial confession, the adoption of which, following consultations with the judicial community and its presentation to the Legislative Assembly, would constitute an important step towards the implementation of this recommendation (see also sect. III A 6).,

(h) Definition of torture and enforced disappearance as offences in
special criminal legislation [LegalReform: Monitor]. The draft new Criminal Code, prepared by the Ministry of Justice, defines torture as a crime against the fundamental rights of the individual. Also defined as a crime is enforced disappearance itself, enforced disappearance carried out by individuals in compliance with official orders and enforced disappearance that implies responsibility for allowing or agreeing to the commission of that crime. Implementation of the recommendation
began with the proposal of the Ministry of Justice and will culminate in the adoption of the corresponding law (see sect. III B 6).,

(i) Legislation regulating the conduct of law enforcement officials. The Ministry of Justice has taken a first step by preparing the draft law on Rules for Administrative Detention aimed at avoiding excesses and abuses in the use of
physical force in detention through the adoption as internal law of the Republic
of the Code of Conduct for Law Enforcement Officials, adopted by the United Nations General Assembly (see also sect. II B 4 (a)) [LegalReform, PoliceReform: Monitor].,

(j) Abolition of the practice of arbitrary detention for petty misdemeanours. The implementation of this recommendation is being prompted by
ONUSAL in coordination with the National Police, the National Civil Police, the
Supreme Court and the municipalities [LegalReform: Monitor., PoliceReform: Monitor, Advocate]. Pending the adoption of legal reforms, various verification processes have been carried out and a police instructive
was adopted with a view to diminishing this type of arbitrary detention (see also sect. III B 4 (a)).,

(k) Temporary application of the Act governing the procedure for administrative detention or the imposition of administrative fines. The police instructive mentioned in the previous point was conceived with a view to
applying the law on procedures for the imposition of arrest or administrative fine (Legislative Decree No. 457) instead of obsolete provisions of the Police Law of 1886 or illegal procedures. A programme for the National Civil Police, National Police, Municipal Police and the Executive Antinarcotics Unit
establishing compulsory application of Decree No. 457 in the transition period pending the repeal of the Police Law of 1886 and the removal from the jurisdiction of the police of petty misdemeanors is urgently needed [PoliceReform: Monitor].,

(l) Amendment of the disciplinary regime under the Career Judicial Service Act so that the Court or its President can investigate formally any irregularities or violations of due process [JusticeReform: Monitor]. ONUSAL has been carrying out consultations with the Supreme Court of Justice for the application of this
recommendation [JusticeReform: AssistOther], the implementation of which is indispensable for assuring the effectiveness of the guarantees for due process, especially with regard to the right to a defence, to be judged by a competent court in a reasonable time-frame and to an impartial trial.,
[…]

(n) Investigations by the Supreme Court of Justice of violations of due process. The disciplinary regime under the Career Judicial Service Act has not yet been modified with a view to allowing the Supreme Court of Justice or its President to investigate ex officio and efficiently the irregularities or violations of the right to due process, particularly those pointed out by the National Counsel for the Defence of Human Rights Office [JusticeReform, HumanRights: Monitor]. The Human Rights
Division has conveyed to the Supreme Court a list of cases in which the responsibility of some judges appears involved [HumanRights: Assist, JusticeSectorReform: AssistOther]. The Court is currently investigating them.,

(o) Granting of legal recognition to associations and trade unions [CivilSocietyAssistance: Monitor]. In spite of some advances within the framework of the consulting mechanism,
compliance with this recommendation is still pending.,

(p) Military training [MilitaryReform: Monitor]. This recommendation is being applied and by its very nature is a process which should be ongoing. The Human Rights Division will propose a specific cooperation programme to the Armed Forces in this regard
(see also sect. II A 5).,

(q) Recovery of military weapons. Partial implementation of this recommendation has begun [MilitaryReform: Monitor]. The Government has committed itself to collecting the remaining arms, which are located in various institutions, and to replacing them
by other, appropriate ones, by 20 November. The remaining military arms in the possession of civilians or ex-military personnel will be collected following the adoption of the ""Law for the control of arms, munitions, explosives and similar articles"", a draft of which was submitted by the Government to the Legislative Assembly on 25 August 1993. Another draft for the same law, prepared by COPAZ, is being debated for subsequent submission to the Assembly [LegalReform: Monitor].,

Minister of Defence for his consideration a project entitled ""Project of
cooperation between the Division of Human Rights of ONUSAL and the Doctrine and

was repeatedly broken in a series of violent incidents, involving attacks by
Tajik opposition fighters against the Russian border forces and retaliation, at
times harsh and indiscriminate, by those forces against targets on Afghan
territory:
(a) On 7 April a convoy of 180 members of the Kazakh contingent of the
Russian border forces was ambushed by opposition fighters, east of Kalaikhumb in
Gorno-Badakshan. Twenty soldiers were reported killed and 26 injured.,
(b) On 8 and 9 April, opposition fighters attacked the Russian border

(c) On 8 April, the Russian border forces in Pyanj reported an
infiltration attempt by 30 members of the opposition, to which they reacted with
rocket fire.,
(d) on 9 and 10 April, fighting took place between the Russian border
forces and the opposition in Kalot in Gorno-Badakshan.,
(e) On 10 April, opposition fighters attacked the Russian border forces
barracks at Vanj, east of Kalaikhumb. Intermittent fighting continued until
16 April.,
(f) On 13 April, Russian aircraft bombed Talokan in northern Afghanistan,
causing a large number of civilian casualties and heavy damage in the city. On
18 April, members of the Joint Commission and UNMOT visited Talokan to interview
witnesses and survey the damage caused by the bombing [Operations_UseofForce: Monitor].,

UNPREDEP_S/1996/65;8;3258;"8. Since its establishment, the mission has worked closely with the
International Conference on the Former Yugoslavia (ICFY). This cooperation has
mainly involved two areas: humanitarian issues and the promotion of dialogue on
human rights issues involving ethnic communities and national minorities.
UNPREDEP and the Humanitarian Issues Working Group of ICFY also strive to
provide a valuable framework for peacemaking, peace-building and humanitarian
activities in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. Another area of
cooperation relates to ethnic and minority rights. In this connection, UNPREDEP
and the ICFY Working Group on Ethnic and National Communities and Minorities
have cooperated in promoting legislative and practical improvements in favour of
the Albanian and other nationalities [LegalReform: Assist with IA]. A series of meetings concentrated on new
legislation in the fields of education and local self-government, as a result of
which some legislation in those fields has already been adopted [LegalReform: Meeting with IA]. Language
issues and questions pertaining to citizenship and display of national symbols
have also been discussed. Most recently, questions relating to media have been
addressed [Media: Meeting with IA]. The ICFY Working Group sponsored an agreement between the
Governments of Denmark and Switzerland on one hand and the Macedonian Radio and
Television on the other, which provides for the delivery of television equipment
for the tripling of emission time in Albanian and for a considerable increase in
air time for languages of other nationalities [Media: Assist with IA].";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;Meeting,InternationalActor,Assist;;;;;;;;;Meeting,InternationalActor,Assist
UNPREDEP_S/1996/65;6;3257;"6. The role of the political affairs component of UNPREDEP has expanded as a
result of the diversified nature and growing significance of the mission’s
mandate pursuant to paragraph 12 of resolution 908 (1994) of 31 March 1994. It
has been effectively monitoring developments in the country, including possible
areas of conflict, with a view to promoting reconciliation among various
political and ethnic groups [LocalReconciliation: Implement]. The presence of civilian police monitors has
considerably strengthened the mission’s outreach to local civil authorities and
institutions, in particular the police. Civilian police have also played an
indispensable role in regular monitoring of areas populated by ethnic
minorities. The mission’s press and information unit has been active in raising
public awareness on the unique role of UNPREDEP as the first United Nations
preventive deployment operation of its kind.

observers have continued to monitor the situation in Prevlaka, which has been
generally quiet and stable. In early January 1996, however, Croatian tanks and
other military equipment were observed in an area to the south-east of
Dubrovnik, but none of these movements by the Croatian army was in the area of
the demilitarized zone [Demilitarization: Monitor]. Pursuant to resolution 1038 (1996), it is my intention
to maintain 28 United Nations military observers in the Prevlaka area, under the
command and direction of a Chief Military Observer, who will report directly to
United Nations Headquarters in New York. The mission will be known as United
Nations Mission of Observers in Prevlaka (UNMOP).";;;;Monitor;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
UNCRO_S/1996/83;5;3252;"5. In the former Sectors North, South and West, UNCRO continued, up to the
expiration of its mandate on 15 January 1996, to monitor and report on the human
rights situation of the remaining Serbs and of those Serbs detained as a result
of Croatian military actions in May and August 1995 [HumanRights: Monitor]. The situation of the Serbs
who have remained in Croatia has shown some improvement as a result of measures
taken by the Government of Croatia, including intensified efforts by local
authorities to address the pressing humanitarian needs in the former sectors.
In addition, the Government’s recommendation to the Sabor to extend the time
period for the Croatian Serb owners of property to return to Croatia to reclaim
their property is a positive development. At the end of December 1995, charges
of armed rebellion were dismissed against 450 Serb detainees., however, the
International Committee of the Red Cross continues to monitor 389 people who
have been detained in relation to the conflict. The lack of specificity of
charges and inadequate legal representation for those Serbs who are still
detained continue to be of concern. While small groups of Serbs have been
readmitted to Croatia, the right to return is still being severely curtailed by
the absence of constructive measures to facilitate the process of return.";;;;;;;Monitor;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Representative is maintaining closE! contact wit h all parties conce:rned. In
recent meetings with my Special Reprei.,entativ·e, the President of the Republic of
Croatia, Mr. Franjo Tudjman, stated clearly that he could not agre,? to a further
extension of the mandate of UNCRO. However, he would agree to retain the two
currently deployed battalions as a tiransitional arrangement. He has insisted
that the implementation of the bas:.c: agreement, particularly its
demilitarization aspects, begin on 1 December [Demilitarization: Meeting]. However, to terminate the UNCRO
mandate on 30 November 1995 without the cert ,:1.inty that other insti·:utions are
able to assume the responsibility l:oir the imple mentation of the ba:.,ic agreement
could severely destabilize the area . In the light of the position taken by
President Tudjman, the Council may wish to m,:1.intain the presence of UNCRO for a
transitional period of two months or until it has decided on the deployment of
the international force, whichever is the so-,:me r . During this peri.od, UNCRO
could facilitate and provide appropri ate ass ist ance to the deployment of the

Croatia and that those Serbs who fled following the recapture of Sectors West,
North and South are welcome to return. However, UNCRO continues to receive from
its Human Rights Action Teams well-documented reports of human rights abuses and
destruction of property. The incidents described in those reports do nothing to
restore confidence among the Serb minority. A continuing United Nations
presence in Croatia will provide one means of monitoring human rights, thus
helping to restore the confidence of those Serbs considering returning to, or
remaining in, Croatia. In cooperation with the United Nations High Commissioner
for Human Rights, UNCRO will therefore continue to deploy Human Rights Action
Teams to monitor human rights and provide reassurance to those Serbs who wish to
return [HumanRights: Monitor with IA]., these tasks will be carried out in conjunction with the Office of the
United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and other relevant
agencies. Additionally, United Nations involvement in Sector East will enable
the international community to monitor the treatment of the minorities by the

reports of houses and other property being set on fire and/or looted. Although
there were no sightings of houses actually being set alight, many of the reports
indicated that Croatian troops were in the close vicinity of the burning houses
and in many of the areas in question all the inhabitants had already fled. On
8 August, for instance, United Nations civilian police reported that houses in
ZaZvici, Djevrske and Kistanje, in Sector South, were on fire [HumanRights: Monitor]. A human rights
action team reported on 10 August that 35 to 40 houses along a 15-kilometre
stretch of road south of Knin towards Drnis were burning., crops had also been
set ablaze. Members of a United Nations battalion reported that on 10 and
11 August houses recently set on fire were observed in nine different villages
in Sector South. In addition, they reported evidence of looting. On 13 August,
a United Nations military observer observed a burning house in Topusko in Sector
North., Croatian soldiers were standing by. As late as 15 August 1995, a human
rights action team reported houses as having been freshly set ablaze in Mircete
in Sector South.

with Mr. Hrvoje Sarinic, the head of the Croatian Commission for Relations with
UNCRO, to allow the United Nations, together with other international
organizations, to cope with the humanitarian difficulties caused by the Croatian
offensive, to monitor the human rights situation and to permit the safe return
of displaced persons (S/1995/666, annex III). The following day, my Special
Representative visited Knin, where he received assurances from the Croatian Army
commander in the area, General Cermak, that that agreement between the United
Nations and Croatia would be respected [HumanitarianRelief, HumanRIghts, RefugeeAssistance: Meeting]. As the situation in Sector South began
to stabilize, Croatian civilian authorities began to assert their control over
the area and Croatian displaced people started returning to identify their

the surrender of Krajina Serb elements collapsed when the Serbs tried to take
heavy weapons systems with them as they withdrew. This led to continued
fighting, with civilians and Krajina Serb troops intermixed on the withdrawal
route, and avoidable casualties resulted. A cease-fire was however successfully
concluded for the Topusko and Glina areas on 8 August, to come into effect the
following day. It provided for the surrender of Serb heavy weapons, the
withdrawal of Krajina Serb soldiers with side arms only, and the safe passage of
civilians from the area. Deplorably, a convoy of displaced people from Sector
North, whose movement had been sanctioned by the cease-fire agreement, was
attacked by a mob of Croatian civilians in Sisak on 9 August. Large numbers of
vehicles were damaged and many people injured. One woman died subsequently of
her wounds. Croatian police, who were present at the scene, intervened only
after pressure from United Nations civilian police monitors (UNCIVPOL) [Operations_PatrolsInterventions: Advocate].

UNCRO_S/1995/650;21;3231;"21. At present, the overall human rights situation is stable but remains
fragile. There is no evidence of systematic violations of human rights against
the Serb population but there are individual cases of discrimination against,
and harassment of, local Serbs, such as lack of access to official documents,
denial of property rights, e.g. the return of livestock, and continuing
incidents of theft and intimidation. These violations erode the confidence of
the community and degrade the status and dignity of the residual Serb
population. Meanwhile, UNCRO has continued to support the process of
confidence-building and rehabilitation promoted by the Croatian Government,
though in some instances it has been difficult to identify concrete evidence of
the implementation of the Croatian Government's policy [HumanitarianRelief: Assist]. For example, the
provision of funds to Serbs for reconstruction has been relatively slow and many
Serbs will not be able to start reconstruction this year. Some actions of the
Croatian authorities fail to take sufficient account of the fears of the Serb
community. For instance, Croatian officials have recently started registering
members of the Serb population in a way that creates the fear that Serb males of
military age will be mobilized. These factors, together with continuing reports
of intimidation and limited economic opportunities, have produced anxiety and
uncertainty, which could generate a new exodus of Serbs.";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;Assist;;;;

United Nations Civilian Police has recently been enhanced through increased
cooperation with the Croatian police, especially in the southern part of the

their desire to return. The Croatian authorities have, in principle, approved
their return. Approval from the authorities in the Federal Republic of
Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro) has been sought [RefugeeAssistance: Advocate with IA], but a reply has yet to be
received. The return of even a small number of Serbs would be significant as it
would help to restore the confidence of the Serbian community in Sector West and

during the period from 9 to 30 May 1995. Between 2 June, when the bridge over
the Sava river was damaged, and 7 July 1995, UNCRO and representatives of UNHCR
assisted a further 130 Serbs to travel to Eastern Slavonia (Sector East) and for
16 to go to Banja Luka via Sector North [RefugeeAssistance: Implement with IA]. Currently, in the former Serbcontrolled
part of Sector West, there are less than 1,000 Serbs in
Pakrac/Gavrinica and about 250 in Okucani, with a further 5,000 or so in the

agreement, but is prevented from doing so satisfactorily by the numerous and
permanent restrictions on its freedom of movement [HostilityOther: Physical]. Nor have its efforts to
deploy along the international border of Croatia received the necessary
cooperation of the Krajina Serbs. Although I am unable to report any progress
in the establishment of the full border-monitoring regime set out in my report
of 18 April 1995 (S/1995/320), it is to be noted that UNCRO at present has
21 checkpoints and observation posts that monitor and report on cross-border
military traffic. In addition, military observers are often able to report upon
such traffic [BorderControl: Monitor]. Monitoring during the period from 5 to 30 July indicates a
regular pattern of movement into and out of Croatia. A total of 7,946 soldiers
with 1,212 vehicles were observed moving into Croatia and 8,610 soldiers with
1,049 vehicles left that country. An additional six border control posts remain
to be established and my Special Representative recognizes the need to establish
them at the earliest opportunity.";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;Monitor;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

zone of separation in the area of Sibenik and Sinj, and infiltration into the
Velebit mountains inside the zone, have contributed to the general climate of
hostility. The Krajina Serbs are convinced that Croatia plans an attack against
Sector South, and have responded by occupying two villages within the zone of
separation, south of Novigrad. Efforts by my Special Representative and by
United Nations commanders to defuse the situation by establishing observation
posts and border-monitoring posts have been thwarted by the postponement of a

mission should continue, but they have done so mainly for different purposes.
The Croatian Government has welcomed the presence of a large number of
international observers and monitors in Sector West to attest to its efforts to
pursue high standards of respect for the remaining Serbs’ human rights [HumanRights: Meeting]. Local
Serb authorities have requested a United Nations presence to monitor the
latter’s situation, to facilitate the voluntary departure of those who wish to
leave, to investigate human rights abuses and to press for the withdrawal of
Croatian army and police forces from the area [Demilitarization: Meeting]. The Serb side has also sought
international assistance for over 10,000 refugees and displaced persons who fled
from Sector West [RefugeeAssistance: Meeting], but has restricted UNCRO movement in all the Sectors it
controls [HostilityOther: Physical], thus making it impossible for UNCRO to monitor the situation of the
remaining Croats. The Croatian Government has expressed its deep concern about
the situation of Croat minorities who have remained in the other Sectors as well
as in Bosnian Serb-held areas of Bosnia and Herzegovina.";;;;Meeting;;;Meeting;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;Meeting;;
UNCRO_S/1995/467;45;3218;"45. The Croatian military offensive in Sector West on 1 May 1995 provided a
bitter example of the consequences that occur when conflicting parties forsake
peaceful options and resort to war. The fact that the attack took place despite
the presence of United Nations peace-keepers in the Sector underlines the
reality that, without the cooperation of the parties, peace-keeping forces
cannot keep the peace. While the presence of United Nations forces and
negotiators was critical for achieving the cessation-of-hostilities agreement of
3 May 1995, for preventing escalation and for monitoring the subsequent
humanitarian and human rights situation of Serbs in the Sector [HumanitarianRelief, HumanRights: Monitor], it was not
sufficient to prevent the sequence of events leading to the Croatian offensive
nor to forestall the offensive itself.";;;;;;;Monitor;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;Monitor;;;;

from United Nations and European agencies, including UNHCR, the United Nations
Office at Vienna, the European Community Monitoring Mission, the European
Community Task Force and ICRC. Human rights monitoring has been undertaken by
UNCRO and the Centre for Human Rights and other organizations [HumanRights: Monitor with IA]. Several
international and local non-governmental organizations (NGOs) have begun to work
with the Serb population. However, these confidence-building initiatives, along
with the support of Croatian authorities, do not appear to have had much effect
on the Serbs remaining in the Sector, most of whom still appear determined to

carefully. As a result, several families changed their minds and a few remain
undecided, but the majority appear to have decided to depart. In order to
inform Serbs of their right to stay, if they so wish, a programme to visit
families and villages has been carried out by UNCRO, in full cooperation with
UNHCR. Efforts are also being made by UNCRO to obtain guarantees from the
Croatian Government that it will allow those who left in haste to return if they
so wish. The Croatian Government has offered assurances that it will do so and
some people have expressed to UNHCR an interest in returning. Since many Serbs
owned their houses and land in the Sector, the return will depend considerably
on securing those assets. Firm assurances have accordingly been sought from the
Croatian Government that they will be safeguarded [CivilianProtection: Advocate].";;;;;;Advocate;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Operation Safe Passage was set up by UNCRO, with the assistance of UNHCR, to
provide secure transportation for those Serbs who wished to leave Croatia for
parts of Bosnia and Herzegovina under the control of Bosnian Serb forces [CivilianProtection, RefugeeAssistance: Implement with IA].
Approximately 2,169 Serbs have left Croatia since the Operation began on
9 May 1995. All were interviewed by both Croatian officials and UNHCR prior to
their departure. Their right to stay was carefully explained but they all

indeterminate number of civilians are believed to have died on 2 May 1995 in

had a major impact on the Serbs in the southern part of the Sector. The
Croatian Government has since initiated measures to alleviate its effects. The
investigations undertaken by UNCRO reveal that there have been instances of
serious violations of human rights [HumanRights: Monitor]., however, these do not appear to have been
systematic or part of a larger strategic design. Croatian police have, in
general, performed in a professional fashion and the Croatian Government has
shown a willingness to cooperate with UNCRO and other United Nations agencies in

role entrusted to it under the cessation-of-hostilities agreement of 3 May 1995.
Vehement accusations of partiality [HostilityGov: Verbal] were levelled against those personnel who

underlying attitude of cynicism towards the mission, its personnel and its
ability to fulfil its mandate. Moreover, the offensive in Sector West, despite

Croatian military offensive and for several days afterwards, severe restrictions
of movement were placed on UNCRO personnel [HostilityGov: Physical], although some international

of over 1,400 Serbs, mostly male, in detention centres was generally monitored

their withdrawal from the zone of separation has not yet been achieved, although
there have been significant efforts to improve compliance. On the Croatian
side, severe restrictions of movement limit UNCRO’s ability to verify
violations [HostilityGov: Physical, Demilitarization: Monitor]. However, as of 8 June 1995, over 578 Croatian soldiers were
observed inside the zone of separation or entering it and 16 heavy weapons were
observed inside the zone at different times. In addition, 28 heavy weapons were
within the 10- and 20-kilometre zones prescribed by the cease-fire agreement [Demilitarization: Monitor].

While the latter number is a major improvement, it is of concern that Croatian
troops continue to be deployed in very close proximity to the zone of
separation, from where they would be able to reoccupy previous positions
quickly. Thus their withdrawal from the zone of separation has largely
satisfied the technical demands of the Council but has not gone far enough to
reduce tensions and remove the apprehension of the Serb side that further
attacks could soon occur. Moreover, the Croatian position is that their forces
will withdraw only to the positions they held before the military offensive on
1 May 1995. It should be recalled that the integrity of the cease-fire
agreement of 29 March 1994 had already been seriously undermined following the
announcement by the Croatian Government on 12 January 1995 that it would no
longer consent to UNPROFOR’s presence. Thus a return to the positions of
1 May 1995 is not adequate to reduce overall tensions, nor would it constitute
full compliance with the Council’s demands.";;;;Monitor;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

retaliatory missile attacks and subsequent escalation. The situation remained
tense because of the continued presence of Croatian Army and Krajina Serb forces
in and along the zone of separation. Negotiations at all levels were conducted
with the Croatian Army to secure the withdrawal of its regular brigades [Demilitarization: Advocate]. The

infirm persons being carried on an UNPROFOR medical convoy [HumanitarianRelief: Implement] that left Potocari on
Wednesday, 13 July. The convoy was first stopped by Bosnian Serb soldiers at
Kravica, where UNPROFOR troops were forced to give the Bosnian Serb army
soldiers their flak jackets. Near the confrontation line, the convoy was again
stopped and Bosnian Serb soldiers forced between 30 and 40 persons off the
trucks. The process was violent and at least one wounded man was severely
beaten [HostilityOther: Violent]. An UNPROFOR soldier confirmed that the Bosnian Serb soldiers pulled the
wounded off the trucks, kicked and pushed them and hit them with their guns.
The most seriously wounded remained on the trucks and were forced to return to
Bratunac with the UNPROFOR soldiers. During the trip the convoy was again
stopped, this time for a period of some seven hours and the medical staff was
not allowed to treat the patients. One man died during the night, apparently
from lack of medical care.";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;Implement;;;;

Serb soldiers stopped the buses and demanded that displaced people give them
money and jewellery [RefugeeAssistance: Monitor]. A location frequently mentioned for those stops was near
Konjevic Polje. The soldiers would enter a bus and make a variety of threats,
including shooting in the air, in order to force the passengers to surrender
their valuables. Several people described being threatened with knives by
soldiers in order to force their cooperation. The looting and burning of Muslim
homes in Srebrenica by Bosnian Serb soldiers was also reported.

bodies of 6 to 10 men who had apparently been executed. After hearing from
displaced persons rumours of dead bodies, at least two teams of UNPROFOR
personnel went to investigate the scene [Operations_UseofForce: Monitor]. Both teams found 10 (according to one

of a fact-finding mission of the Civil Affairs component of the United Nations
Peace Forces (UNPF) which spent eight days in the Tuzla area. The Civil Affairs
team, working in conjunction with the Centre for Human Rights of the United
Nations Secretariat, gathered information concerning human rights abuses that
occurred following the fall of Srebrenica by interviewing displaced persons and
holding discussions with representatives of numerous international organizations
and local non-governmental organizations active in the area, including the
UNHCR, ICRC, Médecins sans frontières (Holland), the European Community
Monitoring Mission, the Tuzla Citizens Forum and the Helsinki Citizens Assembly [HumanRights: Monitor with IA].

the war in Bosnia and Herzegovina., that is a task for the peacemakers, currently
led by the members of the ""Contact Group"", who are supported by the two
Co-Chairmen of the Steering Committee of the International Conference on the
Former Yugoslavia and by my Special Representative. Nor is it an army that has
been sent out to fight on one side in the war, though it is often criticized as
if it had failed to prosecute a war effectively. It is, instead, a mission
deployed by the Security Council to fulfil three purposes: to alleviate the
consequences of the war, notably through helping in the provision of
humanitarian aid., to contain the conflict, and mitigate its consequences, by
imposing constraints on the belligerents, through the establishment of such
arrangements as a ""no-fly zone"", safe areas and exclusion zones., and to promote
the prospects for peace by negotiating local cease-fires and other arrangements,
maintaining these where possible and providing support for measures aimed at an
overall political settlement. The Force has so far had considerable success in
fulfilling these purposes, but they are not an end in themselves [Demlitarization, CivilianProtection: Implement, HumanitarianRelief: ProvideSecurity]. They attempt
to produce conditions that will enable the peacemakers to negotiate an overall
solution.";;;;Implement;;Implement;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;ProvideSecurity;;;;

available to reduce the risks to the Force's personnel, though these all involve
ceasing important assigned tasks. Weapons collection points [Demilitarization: Implement], for example, can
be abandoned. UNPROFOR can cease anti-sniping patrols [Operations_PatrolsInterventions: Implement]. Larger convoys can be
operated, but they will be less frequent and overall delivery rates may be less
efficient. Increasing the numbers of personnel deployed at observation posts [Demilitarization: Monitor]
can improve security to some extent but limits the number of posts that can be

UNPROFOR_S/1995/444_BiH;50;3179;"50. UNPROFOR's mandate as regards the exclusion zones can be summarized as
follows:
(a) To monitor the parties' compliance with them.,
(b) To control the heavy weapons placed by the parties in designated
weapons collection points.
The experience of recent weeks in Sarajevo has shown that this mandate
immediately ceases to be viable if the parties fail to honour their commitments.
UNPROFOR has found it impossible to prevent the Bosnian Serb side, in
particular, from entering the weapons collection points [Demilitarization: Implement] and either withdrawing
heavy weapons or firing them from within those sites. By the date of this
report, UNPROFOR had lost control of all the weapons collection points in the
Sarajevo exclusion zone. It has also become clear that both parties introduced
heavy weapons into the exclusion zones after implementation of the agreements of
February 1994.";;;;Implement;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
UNPROFOR_S/1995/444_BiH;47;3178;"47. I remain convinced that the best way to achieve these objectives is for the
parties to agree on the demilitarization of the city. My Special Representative
has worked hard to attain this goal and has been encouraged by recent
reaffirmations by Bosnian Government officials of their continued interest in
it [Training coded with a question mark as Demilitarization: Advocate/Meeting, but it is too vague to be coded]. Unfortunately, however, it is evident that there is at this time
insufficient trust between the parties for even a step-by-step demilitarization
process to begin.";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

UNPROFOR_S/1995/444_BiH;39;3176;"39. UNPROFOR's capacity to carry out its safe-area mandate has also been
affected by the Bosnian Serbs' denial of freedom of movement to and from the
three eastern safe areas (Gorazde, Srebrenica, Zepa) [CivilianProtection: Implement
HostilityOther: Physical], as a result of which
resupply of UNPROFOR personnel by road has become virtually impossible.
UNPROFOR's stocks of fuel in these three safe areas have recently fallen to
dangerously low levels. If the Bosnian Serb side persists in blocking resupply
convoys, the only way to resupply UNPROFOR personnel in these three areas would

be by helicopter, which would involve considerable dangers and of which I would
inform the Security Council.";;;;;;Implement;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
UNPROFOR_S/1995/444_BiH;35;3175;"35. However, UNPROFOR's ability to carry out its safe-area mandate and
particularly to deter deliberate attacks on the areas has been severely limited
by the inherent deficiencies of the safe-area regime, to which I have more than
once drawn the Council's attention, most recently in my report of
1 December 1994 (S/1994/1389), and by the military activities of the two sides [CivilianProtection: Implement].
In recent weeks these difficulties have increased as relations have deteriorated
between the parties and the safe areas have been drawn into the intensifying
conflict throughout the country.";;;;;;Implement;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
UNPROFOR_S/1995/444_BiH;34;3174;"34. UNPROFOR has had mixed results in carrying out its responsibilities in the
safe areas [CivilianProtection: Implement]. When the consent and cooperation of the parties has been
forthcoming, it has achieved considerable success. The presence of observers
and patrols has enabled the Force to monitor cease-fires, stabilize
confrontation lines and improve security by resolving localized disputes or
outbreaks of fighting [Operations_PatrolsInterventions: Implement]. Its military and civilian staff have also assisted in
arranging medical evacuations, delivering and reporting on humanitarian aid, and
brokering local agreements to improve the population's living conditions [HumanitarianRelief: Monitor, Advocate, Implement].
Finally, the presence of even limited United Nations forces has enhanced
security for international humanitarian workers and provided a capacity to

UNPROFOR_S/1995/444_BiH;28;3173;"28. These tasks have continued to constitute the main demands on UNPROFOR's
time and resources in Bosnia and Herzegovina [HumanitarianRelief: ProvideSecurity with IA]. The difficulties impeding their
full implementation have been fully described in many previous reports to the
Security Council. They centre essentially on the refusal by the various
parties, but especially by the Bosnian Serbs, to respect UNPROFOR's freedom of
movement and their readiness in some areas to use humanitarian assistance as a
means of furthering their war aims. This can take the form of denying such
assistance to populations that the party concerned is trying to drive from their
homes. It can also take the form of seizing a proportion of humanitarian
cargoes for the party's own use. In spite of these difficulties, UNHCR and
UNPROFOR have been successful in meeting the humanitarian requirements in most
parts of Bosnia and Herzegovina. As the following table shows, it is mainly in
Bihac, and more recently in Sarajevo, that non-cooperation by the parties has
caused major shortfalls in delivery of the targeted assistance:

High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) has become the longest lasting such
airlift in aviation history. It has succeeded in delivering more than
150,000 tons of humanitarian relief to the people of Sarajevo and has been an
important means of meeting UNPROFOR's logistic needs in that city. However,
deteriorating conditions in recent weeks have brought about a situation in which
UNPROFOR, denied the cooperation of the parties, is no longer able to ensure the
security of the airport and its installations or the uninterrupted continuation
of humanitarian operations there [HumanitarianRelief: ProvideSecurity with IA]. Comparative figures for the number of flights
and tons of humanitarian relief delivered in the months of March and April 1993,

an unavoidable but high cost in detained personnel and in the complete isolation
of United Nations forces in the Sarajevo area. UNPROFOR has also lost control
over heavy weapons in collection points [Demilitarization: Implement] from which its personnel have been
removed and is subjected to further restrictions on its freedom of movement [HostilityOther: Physical].
There has been a complete breakdown in negotiations to reopen Sarajevo airport
and utilities are again being cut [During the training, this was coded Demilitarization, StateAuthority: Advocate, but now I think it is too stretched]. The problem of resupply in Sarajevo and the
eastern enclaves has been further aggravated. Finally, the ability of United
Nations forces to operate effectively, efficiently and safely throughout much of
Bosnia and Herzegovina, on the basis of impartiality and the consent of all
parties, is now seriously compromised.";;;;Implement;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
UNPROFOR_S/1995/444_BiH;14;3170;"14. On 27 May 1995, the Serbs seized an UNPROFOR observation post [Demilitarization: Monitor] at the
Vrbanja bridge in Sarajevo and detained some United Nations soldiers [HostilityOther: Physical]. The
position was recaptured by UNPROFOR at the cost of 2 dead and 14 wounded. There
were also Serb casualties [Operations_UseofForce: Implement]. The same day, it became apparent that some UNPROFOR
detainees were being moved to other locations. The next day, Bosnian Serb
forces detained additional UNPROFOR personnel [HostilityOther: Physical] whose movements had been blocked
following the air strikes or who were necessarily deployed at exposed locations
in the Gorazde area. As of 30 May 1995, UNPROFOR reported that 199 personnel
were detained by the Bosnian Serb forces, many of them in humiliating
circumstances and in violation of international norms of military conduct, and
that a further 224 were at locations where access and movement were being denied
by those forces.";;;;Monitor;;;;;;;;;Implement;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
UNPROFOR_S/1995/444_BiH;13;3169;"13. Constraints on observation from both the ground and the air made it
difficult to verify compliance by both sides with the requirement to clear heavy
weapons from the exclusion zone by 1200 hours on 26 May 1995 [Demilitarization: Monitor]. Relative calm had
returned to the city. The situation with respect to UNPROFOR detainees was
uncertain and dangerous. For all these reasons, it was decided to review the
situation before considering further military action.";;;;Monitor;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
UNPROFOR_S/1995/444_BiH;12;3168;"12. The first air strike took place at 1620 hours on 25 May 1995, as a result
of the failure of the Bosnian Serbs to respect the deadline for the return of
heavy weapons. The target, limited to two bunkers within an ammunition dump
near Pale, was selected in order to make an effective strike while reducing the
risk of casualties or unnecessary collateral damage. After the strike, Bosnian
Serb forces surrounded a number of weapons collection points [Demilitarization: Implement]. All safe areas,
except Zepa, were shelled, resulting in particularly heavy casualties in Tuzla,
where some 70 civilians were killed and over 130 injured. As the Serbs had
again employed heavy weapons around Sarajevo and had still failed to return the
missing weapons to weapons collection points, a second attack on the six
remaining bunkers in the Pale ammunition dump was conducted at 1030 hours on
26 May 1995. Bosnian Serb forces reacted by surrounding additional weapons
collection points, taking United Nations military observers into custody [HostilityOther: Physical] and
using a number of them as human shields to deter further air attacks on
potential targets and by cutting electricity to the city.";;;;Implement;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
UNPROFOR_S/1995/444_BiH;11;3167;"11. While all possible protective measures were taken, UNPROFOR had no
alternative but to continue its mandated tasks. In any case, many observation
posts and weapons collection points were located in Serb-held areas and already
subject to strict and detailed control of movement by the Bosnian Serbs [Demilitarization: Monitor, Implement
HostilityOther: Physical].
Although it was possible to improve local defences and to suspend resupply
convoys, large numbers of exposed personnel could not be withdrawn because of
the overriding requirement to maintain observation and liaison. It would also
have made little sense to conduct air strikes to achieve the return of a few
heavy weapons if the United Nations had no personnel at the weapons collection
points to monitor their return., nor would it have made sense to abandon the
hundreds of weapons in other sites.";;;;Monitor,Implement;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
UNPROFOR_S/1995/444_BiH;10;3166;"10. Late on 24 May 1995, my Special Representative issued a statement
emphasizing the seriousness of the situation. This was followed by a warning by
the Commander of UNPROFOR to the Bosnian Government and the Bosnian Serb party
that their forces would be attacked from the air if all heavy weapons did not
cease firing by 1200 hours the next day [Demilitarization: Implement]. Four heavy weapons removed from
weapons collection points by the Serbs were also to be returned at the same
time. A second deadline, 24 hours later, was established for the removal out of
range, or the placement in weapons collection points, of all heavy weapons that
had been introduced into the area by the two sides. When issuing this warning,
UNPROFOR recognized that non-compliance would require a strong response and that
a significant risk to exposed UNPROFOR personnel was likely to result.";;;;Implement;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
UNPROFOR_S/1995/444_BiH;9;3165;"9. On 22 May 1995, Bosnian Serb forces removed two heavy weapons from a
weapons collection point [Demilitarization: Implement]. On 24 May 1995, fighting erupted again, with the
Serbs firing heavy weapons from within a number of weapons collection points and
the government forces firing from various positions within the city. Bosnian
Serb forces removed three more weapons from weapons collection points. Tanks
and rocket launchers were also reported within the heavy weapons exclusion zone.
Sixteen civilians and military personnel were killed and at least 60 wounded.
As previous measures had failed to restore respect for the heavy weapons
agreement, and as neither side appeared ready to stop fighting, UNPROFOR decided
to use all available means to restore compliance with the February 1994
agreement.";;;;Implement;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

unlikely, unless there is substantial progress on both the economic agreement

experts agreed to start work as quickly as possible on repairs and de-mining.
On 9 January, UNPROFOR engineers began detailed inspections of four water
facilities in Sectors North, South and West [StateAdministration: Monitor]. Preliminary UNPROFOR inspections
indicate that at least two of the 13 water and electricity projects listed in
the economic agreement could be technically completed within two months
depending on the extent of the de-mining necessary, snow conditions and adequate
financial resources. The first phase of these repairs could be completed by
24 February. If these projects were to be completed expeditiously, water could
be provided before summer to coastal towns in Dalmatia, including Zadar and
Biograd, which have been without adequate water supply for four years.

paved the way for the repair and return to the Croatian Serb side, beginning on
17 January 1995, of the generator poles of the Obrovac´ hydroelectric station,
which had been in the control of the Croatian authorities for four years. It
also created a stimulus for the implementation of other priority areas of the
economic agreement, in particular the opening of the Adriatic oil pipeline which
passes through Sector North. At meetings of technical experts of both sides on
25 December and 5 and 11 January, differences over modalities for its operation
were resolved and technical inspections commenced. While ICFY pursued
negotiations for the formation of a joint commercial oil company, UNPROFOR

to clarify priorities and agree on modalities for its implementation [EconomicDevelopment: Meeting]. The
Croatian Government had publicly identified as its immediate priorities the
opening of the part of the Zagreb-Belgrade highway which passes through Sectors
West and East of the UNPAs., the Zagreb-Lipovac and Zagreb-Split railway lines.,
and the Adriatic oil pipeline. On 21 December 1994, the Zagreb-Belgrade highway
was opened in Sectors West and East. The United Nations Civilian Police
(UNCIVPOL) established a Highway Command of 150 monitors to patrol the highway,
together with monitors of the European Union Monitoring Mission in areas under
Croatian control [Operations_PatrolsInterventions: Implement with IA]. UNPROFOR military personnel provided security along the
highway through Sector West [StateAdministration: ProvideSecurity]. UNPROFOR engineers made minor repairs to ensure
safe conditions on the highway [StateAdministration: Implement]. Even though initially the highway was open only
during daylight hours, it was used by hundreds of vehicles daily, including
small numbers of Croatian Serbs travelling between UNPAs West and East. As of

military involvement by their forces in Bosnia and Herzegovina and to allow
UNPROFOR and UNHCR convoy access into the Bihac pocket [Demilitarization: Meeting]. Assurances were also
given regarding the safety of UNPROFOR personnel deployed in the UNPAs.
However, the military involvement of the Krajina Serb forces appeared to
continue, while the Bosnian Serb forces showed no sign of relenting in their
advance towards the safe area of Bihac and the town itself. In spite of
repeated efforts by UNPROFOR to obtain a cease-fire, the Bosnian Serb forces
continued to attack towards the town. The Fifth Corps of the Government Army,

seriously affected by a 12-day cut-off of utilities. Following the use of air
support on 22 September at Sarajevo, all flights to Sarajevo had to be suspended
owing to security threats from the Bosnian Serb forces. The total suspension
for more than 10 days of UNPROFOR and humanitarian flights, as well as of land
convoys, slowed UNPROFOR activities and reduced humanitarian supplies in the
city to a critical level [HumanitarianRelief: Implement]. Access to the city has subsequently been relatively

Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) air action against a Serb armoured vehicle
inside the Sarajevo exclusion zone, causing the Serbs to return the weapons that
had been taken away. Since then, no weapons have been removed from the weapon
collection points. However, firing of heavy weapons by both sides from within
these sites has occurred. Despite the commitment by UNPROFOR of considerable

situation on the ground, I do not recommend the withdrawal of the Force. Its
current tasks are being effectively pursued. Its role in escorting humanitarian
relief convoys has been greatly reduced in the reporting period [HumanitarianRelief: ProvideSecurity]. Increasingly
secure movement has been possible throughout the contiguous territory controlled
by the Federation. UNPROFOR will continue to have a vital role in support of
UNHCR in the delivery of humanitarian assistance in this territory, including
reconnaissance, road repair and maintenance and direct transport [HumanitarianRelief: ProvideSecurity, MaterialSupport with IA]. I should like
to stress, however, that security problems remain in relation to land access to
Sarajevo and the safe areas, and UNPROFOR’s assistance is essential for the
delivery of humanitarian assistance to these enclaves, although the Force alone
cannot ensure access. Even with UNPROFOR support, grave difficulties are
foreseen for the humanitarian assistance programme unless progress is made
towards a peaceful settlement of the conflict. If land access to the safe areas
is denied by the Bosnian and Krajina Serbs, some assistance could continue to be
delivered by air drops. However, this will not be adequate for Sarajevo, where
the airlift can effectively be halted by a single shell or even a single armed
individual.";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;MaterialSupport,ProvideSecurity,InternationalActor;;;;

however, to be weighed against the tasks that are currently being implemented
successfully by UNPROFOR. In measuring the value of its continuing presence, it
is necessary to consider what the costs would be if these tasks were to be
abandoned. In the absence of an overall political settlement acceptable to all
of the parties, UNPROFOR’s current presence and activities in Bosnia and
Herzegovina remain invaluable. UNPROFOR continues to play an essential and
effective role as an impartial force, and represents, in a society faced with

the challenges of reconciliation and restoration, the principles and objectives
of the Charter of the United Nations. Its usefulness [HumanitarianRelief: Implement with IA] in supporting humanitarian
activities, facilitating local cease-fires and disengagements and fostering
reconciliation and cooperation between communities argues in favour of a further
renewal of its mandate.";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;Implement,InternationalActor;;;;
UNPROFOR_S/1994/1067_BiH;42;3144;"42. In addition to these limitations on its capabilities, UNPROFOR has
continued to experience serious restrictions on its freedom of movement imposed
by all sides, and especially by the Bosnian Serbs [ HostilityGov/Other: Physical]. While conducting operations
in the Ozren area, and around Breza and Dastansko, Government forces have denied
access to UNPROFOR patrols [Opeartions_PatrolsInterventions: Implement]and, during the same period, the Serbs have
significantly and frequently restricted convoy movements and patrolling
throughout areas under their control, especially within the exclusion zones.
Particularly serious have been actions by both sides that have led to the
repeated closure of the Sarajevo airport. In the absence of improved relations
between the Government and the Serb party, these difficulties will continue and
may intensify. In particular, the pursuit by either side of military
objectives, however limited or localized, is incompatible with the nature and
purposes of UNPROFOR’s deployment.";;;;;;;;;;;;Implement;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
UNPROFOR_S/1994/1067_BiH;41;3143;"41. With regard to Bosnia and Herzegovina, experience gained over the last six
months has enhanced mutual understanding, joint planning and cooperation between
UNPROFOR and NATO, and the successful deployment of long-awaited additional
forces has enabled UNPROFOR to improve its ability to seize opportunities for
progress. Nevertheless, the possibility of a further exacerbation and
intensification of the conflict in Bosnia and Herzegovina has highlighted
UNPROFOR’s limitations, and underlined a number of areas of concern. First, the
constraints on UNPROFOR’s ability to perform its responsibilities in the safe
areas, outlined in my report of 8 May 1994 pursuant to resolution 844
(S/1994/555), remain largely unchanged. Secondly, the exclusion zones around
Sarajevo and Gorazde, although highly successful in protecting the civilian
population from mortar, artillery and tank fire, are expensive in manpower and
difficult to enforce and cannot be maintained indefinitely in the absence of a
comprehensive cessation of hostilities or, as a minimum, the demilitarization of
those areas [CivilianProtection: Implement]. This latter solution is now being pursued by UNPROFOR for
Sarajevo [Demilitarization: Implement]. It is possible for any side to hide weapons, and UNPROFOR personnel,
who are widely dispersed at weapons collection points, are vulnerable to any
determined effort to remove weapons or take hostages. Thirdly, the supervision
and enforcement of weapons exclusion zones places additional strains on UNPROFOR
as an impartial force. All these difficulties are inherent in UNPROFOR’s nature
as a highly dispersed and lightly armed peace-keeping force that is not
mandated, equipped, trained or deployed to be a combatant.";;;;Implement;;Implement;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
UNPROFOR_S/1994/1067_Croatia;39;3142;"39. Assistance in the creation of conditions that would permit the voluntary
return of displaced persons to their homes in or near the UNPAs continues to be
of the highest priority for UNPROFOR [Croatia: RefugeeAssistance: Implement]. In my report of 15 February 1992
(S/23592), I informed the Council that I had asked that UNHCR assume
responsibility for designing and implementing a scheme for the return of
refugees and displaced persons. This was clearly predicated on a peaceful
resolution of the underlying causes of displacement. With UNHCR assistance,
several thousands of displaced persons have been able to return to their homes
in the Dubrovnik, Sibenik and Zadar hinterlands. Return to more sensitive areas
depends not only on the cease-fire but also on a political settlement, which
alone would provide the conditions for a large-scale return in safety and
dignity. Nevertheless, discussions are taking place among UNHCR, UNPROFOR and
both parties on the implementation of a pilot project for voluntary return to a
few selected villages in or near the zone of separation [Croatia: RefugeeAssistance: Meeting with IA].";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;Implement,Meeting,InternationalActor;;

with this broadened political mandate, my Special Representative has focused on
practical ways of assisting the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia under
these difficult conditions. The focus of UNPROFOR’s political work, in line
with the efforts of the Working Group on Ethnic and National Communities and
Minorities of the International Conference of the Former Yugoslavia, has been on
strengthening mutual understanding and dialogue among political parties and on
monitoring human rights [LocalReconciliation, PartyAssistance: Implement, HumanRights: Monitor (Not sure about LocalReconciliation, as Macedonia is described to be ""stable"" but may not be considered ""post-conflict"" per se)]. UNPROFOR’s military component has successfully
mediated several tense border encounters, achieving the withdrawal of soldiers
on both sides, and in early July succeeded in establishing an UNPROFOR
observation post at Chupino Brdo on the border with the Federal Republic of
Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro) [BorderControl: Implement, MaterialSupport, Operations_PatrolsInterventions: Implement]. In all these activities, UNPROFOR has

of Macedonia in the past six months have been economic. Social stability has
been endangered by rising unemployment and a declining economy resulting,
inter alia, from the effects of the economic blockade imposed by Greece on
17 February 1994 and of the United Nations sanctions against the Federal
Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro), formerly the country’s primary
trading partners. Internal political tensions between Macedonians and ethnic
Albanians have also increased. In order to establish accurate estimates of the
ethnic composition of the population, the Government of the former Yugoslav
Republic of Macedonia conducted a nationwide population census from 25 June to
11 July 1994. The census was financed, partly organized and monitored by the
Council of Europe and the European Union, with assistance from other bodies
including the International Conference on the Former Yugoslavia, the Conference
on Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE) and civilian components of
UNPROFOR [StateAdministration: MaterialSupport with IA]. Official results, as well as an expert assessment of the accuracy of
the census, are expected in mid-October 1994, shortly before the holding of
presidential and parliamentary elections.

improved conditions for the delivery of humanitarian assistance throughout
Central Bosnia. However, since the main prewar road communications with Tuzla
continue to be interrupted by the line of confrontation, that city can be
reached only by secondary roads through mountainous territory. With winter
approaching, these roads will again become a challenge to UNHCR’s and UNPROFOR’s
logistical capabilities. UNPROFOR continues to negotiate for the opening of the
Tuzla airport to humanitarian flights but, despite repeated attempts to

continued to highlight and condemn strongly the incidence of torture, killings
and expulsions of minorities within the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina [HumanRights: Monitor].
Efforts continue to ensure that the treatment of minorities in Serb-held areas
fully complies with international norms and standards. UNPROFOR persists in its
attempts to visit and establish a presence in Serb-controlled areas,
particularly in Banja Luka and Bijeljina, which are the scenes of continued
""ethnic cleansing"" by Bosnian-Serb forces [HumanRights: Monitor]. In this connection, I welcome the

defeated the forces of the self-declared ""Autonomous Province of Western Bosnia""
in the Bihac area, resulting in an exodus of an estimated 25,000 refugees to the
United Nations Protected Area of Sector North in Croatia. UNPROFOR extended
full logistical and medical support to UNHCR and has been actively involved in
creating conditions that would make the repatriation of refugees to the
Velika Kladusa area possible [HumanitarianRelief, RefugeeAssistance: MaterialSupport, Implement with IA]. Meanwhile, government forces have also resumed
operations in the Ozren and Travnik areas and advanced south from the areas of
Breza and Dastansko. All these activities have been met by heavy Bosnian-Serb
shelling and local counter-attacks at many points along the confrontation line.
Although there has been no significant change to the confrontation line
throughout this period and no wide-ranging and sustained general offensive by
either side, the shifting pattern of localized attacks and counter-attacks has
resulted in restrictions by both sides on UNPROFOR’s freedom of movement.
UNPROFOR made several unavailing attempts to persuade both sides to seek a
negotiated rather than a military solution. The continued military activity has
also undermined UNPROFOR’s efforts to achieve a general cessation of hostilities
agreement, as called for in the Council’s presidential statement of 30 June.";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;MaterialSupport,Implement,InternationalActor;;MaterialSupport,Implement,InternationalActor;;

signing on 17 March 1994 of an agreement between the Government of Bosnia and
Herzegovina and the Bosnian-Serb party on freedom of movement in the Sarajevo
area [HumanitarianRelief: Assist (ensuring people's freedom of movement in a conflict-affected area is a typical humanitarian work, but for this project not sure if the activity category should include it) -> UN-CODED]. As a result, two routes across Sarajevo airport, one route from Sarajevo
to Visoko and the bridge at Grbavica were reopened on 23 March 1994 for civilian
traffic and humanitarian goods. From that date until 26 July 1994, when the
Bosnian Serbs suspended the agreement on the airport routes, some 60,000 persons
and over 12,000 vehicles used the Sarajevo-Butmir route, while nearly 100,000
civilians and 19,500 vehicles used the route linking two Serb suburbs. The
other two routes remain open, with the Grbavica bridge used over the same period
by over 6,500 persons and the Sarajevo-Visoko route by 11,500. UNPROFOR has
been actively negotiating the reopening of the routes across the airport that
had brought freedom of movement and a major improvement of living conditions,
including the near-disappearance of black-marketeering, to all citizens of
Sarajevo [HumanitarianRelief: Assist -> UNCODED].";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

a rapidly deteriorating situation in Gorazde (see S/1994/600), which resulted in
the first use of close air support against Serb ground targets on 10 and
11 April 1994. The crisis in Gorazde led me to request additional support from
NATO, which in turn declared an exclusion zone around Gorazde on 22 April 1994.
On the same date, an agreement was reached in Belgrade between Bosnian-Serb
leaders and my Special Representative, facilitated by President Milosevic of
Serbia, that brought the Bosnian-Serb offensive to an end, provided for the
immediate deployment of UNPROFOR military and civilian personnel, established a
cease-fire, which has been largely respected, and required the Bosnian-Serb
forces to withdraw from a 3-kilometre area from the centre of Gorazde town as

between the Bosnian government army and the Bosnian Croat forces (see
S/1994/216), as well as the agreement subsequently reached in Washington on
10 May 1994 on the creation of the Bosniac-Croat Federation, UNPROFOR has been
closely involved in the implementation of all its military aspects, bringing a
large degree of stability and peace to central Bosnia and western Herzegovina.
UNPROFOR was instrumental in achieving a breakthrough in an agreement on freedom
of movement in the Mostar area, which was implemented on 23 May, and resulted in
a rapid improvement in the quality of life for residents on the eastern bank of
the Neretva River. UNPROFOR has also played a pivotal role in monitoring the
demilitarization of Mostar, a precondition for the establishment of the European
Union administration in that city on 23 July 1994 [Demilitarization: Monitor]. In central Bosnia, UNPROFOR
has also been involved, from an early stage, in negotiations on freedom of
movement both for the population and for commercial traffic. While freedom of
movement is not complete, some commercial convoys, under the security provided
by UNPROFOR’s presence, have been able to move from the coast to southern,
central and northern Bosnia. Some infrastructural problems have been overcome,
although economic rehabilitation has barely begun.";;;;Monitor;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

situation in many parts of Bosnia and Herzegovina, events in recent months have
demonstrated the fragility of the peace on the ground. Military restraint by
the warring parties in some areas was undermined by aggressive acts in others,
resulting in a marked variation in progress towards normalization of life in
different parts of the country. The continuation of warfare in parts of Bosnia
and Herzegovina, however, should not be allowed to obscure the largely
successful peace-keeping work carried out by the Force. UNPROFOR has been a
significant factor in facilitating the improvement of the population’s living
conditions through, for example, its promotion of local cease-fires, its
negotiation and implementation of agreements on a variety of issues ranging from
the release of prisoners to the repair and improvement of public services and
its assistance in the evacuation of the wounded and sick [StateAdministration, HumanitarianRelief: Implement].";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;Implement;;;;;;;;;;;;Implement;;;;

International Conference on the Former Yugoslavia, senior officials from the
Croatian Government and local Serb authorities were brought together for
discussions in Knin on 5 August. Committing themselves to continuing the
negotiating process, they agreed to establish eight expert groups to prepare for
future negotiation on specific economic areas. During subsequent contacts
between the International Conference and officials from the Croatian Government
and the local Serb authorities, as well as between my Special Representative and
the latter, agreement was reached to begin negotiations on the opening of the

hostilities between the conflicting sides in Croatia. While the Croatians
quickly implemented the agreement, the Serbs took a longer time to implement key
provisions of it. By the end of May, however, UNPROFOR reported almost total
compliance, characterized, inter alia, by a general cessation of hostilities,
withdrawal of forces beyond fixed lines of separation and the placement of heavy
weapons in agreed storage sites [Demilitarization: Monitor]. UNPROFOR has assumed exclusive control over
the zone of separation, which covers an area of over 1,300 square kilometres.
Since 29 March, the United Nations Civilian Police (UNCIVPOL) has conducted over
6,000 patrols in the zone of separation [Operations_PatrolsInterventions: Implement].

about the total withdrawal of Serb forces from the 3-kilometre zone on the right
bank of the Drina. An arrangement was reached with both parties that should
have entered into force at 1100 hours GMT on 13 May 1994, whereby the Bosnian
Army would have vacated a position it presently occupies on a feature some
1.2 kilometres from the centre of Gorazde on the right bank of the Drina,
forward of the 23 April 1994 cease-fire line, and would have redeployed behind
that line., within 24 hours all Bosnian Serb forces, including armed military,
armed militia and armed civilians, would have withdrawn out of the 3-kilometre
zone on the right bank., UNPROFOR would have verified the fulfilment of the above
redeployment and withdrawal, would have been entitled to search throughout the
exclusion zone on the right bank and would have occupied permanently the
position indicated above, after redeployment of the Bosnian Army forces
presently occupying it. UNPROFOR also recommended, as already mentioned in
paragraph 14 above, that the entire area lying between the cease-fire line and
the edge of the 3-kilometre zone on the right bank of the Drina remain
demilitarized and under its exclusive interim control [Demilitarization: Advocate]. Although on 13 May 1994
the local Bosnian Government Army commander signed the document outlining the
above arrangements and actually withdrew his forces from the position they
occupied, the local Bosnian Serb liaison officer stated that he had no authority
at his level to enter into this agreement. As a result, the Bosnian Army
reoccupied the position it had vacated.";;;;Advocate;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

contrary, it remains the case that UNPROFOR and humanitarian organizations do

exposed to an increasing degree of harassment [HostilityOther: Verbal]. This has included the blocking
or administrative delay for up to five days at a Bosnian Serb army checkpoint at
Rogatica of military resupply and other UNPROFOR convoys, including one
transporting medical assistance from a non-governmental organization (NGO) [HumanitarianRelief: MaterialSupport with IA]. Of
even greater concern, such harassment has, on two separate occasions, included
the temporary detention of UNPROFOR personnel and the theft of their equipment [HostilityOther: Physical]:
(a) At 1840 hours on 7 May 1994, the Canadian occupants of an UNPROFOR
vehicle that had been held up by Bosnian Serbs at Rogatica for over 48 hours
were physically detained. The vehicle was searched and a significant quantity
of forward air control communications equipment and the weapons of the UNPROFOR
officers were stolen. The officers were eventually released., however, as of
13 May 1994, none of the stolen equipment had been returned.,
(b) On 12 May 1994, a three-vehicle United Kingdom convoy was stopped at
gunpoint by Bosnian Serb troops at Podromanija, which is located between
Rogatica and Gorazde. The weapons of the UNPROFOR personnel and some equipment
were seized and the convoy commander (a British major) was forced at gunpoint to
write a statement, which his captors deemed to be unacceptable. The Bosnian
Serbs removed this officer to Rogatica where he was given another statement to

helicopter flights and the denial of freedom of movement to United Nations
civilian policemen from Sarajevo to Gorazde and within the Gorazde 3-kilometre

the Bosnian Serb side was treating Security Council resolution 913 (1994) and

civilian police personnel would take exclusive control of the area lying between
the 23 April 1994 cease-fire line and the edge of the 3-kilometre zone.
Mr. Karadzic undertook to instruct his military commanders to comply. No
progress, however, was made with regard to the Bosnian Serb civilians who have
settled within that zone.

Mr. Radovan Karadzic, my Special Representative emphasized the need for full and
immediate compliance with all the terms of resolution 913 (1994) and the
agreement reached at Belgrade [Demilitarization: Meeting, Advocate]. Mr. Karadzic asserted a need for Bosnian Serb
militiamen to remain within the 3-kilometre exclusion zone on the right bank of
the Drina, in order to protect Bosnian Serb civilians who allegedly originated
from and were then returning to that area in the wake of the recent advance of
Bosnian Serb forces. My Special Representative did not accept this reasoning
and demanded that all armed and uniformed individuals be withdrawn forthwith
from that zone [Demilitarization: Advocate].";;;;Meeting,Advocate;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Prime Minister Haris Silajdzic to discuss the situation in Gorazde [Demilitarization: Meeting]. Prime
Minister Silajdzic emphasized that the presence of Bosnian Serb forces within
the 3-kilometre area was not acceptable, and that full Bosnian Serb compliance
with the total exclusion zone was a precondition for further negotiations. The
Prime Minister also accused the Bosnian Serb side of introducing in that area
civilian settlers who occupied houses abandoned by their legal owners who had
been forcibly displaced during the recent offensive.";;;;Meeting;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

26 April deadline, UNPROFOR forces were able to refocus attention on more
intensive patrolling in the 3-kilometre zone [Demilitarization: Monitor, Operations_PatrolsInterventions: Implement]. As early as 25 April 1994, small
groups of Bosnian Serb militia were being encountered, particularly on the right
bank of the Drina. When confronted with this information, the Bosnian Serb
authorities stated that those persons were demobilized militia or police and had
been left in the area to ensure the security of Bosnian Serb civilians. On
30 April, a serious incident occurred within the 3-kilometre exclusion zone,
during which an UNPROFOR patrol twice came under fire from Bosnian Serb
soldiers [Operations_PatrolsInterventions: Implement, HostilityOther: Violence]. UNPROFOR soldiers returned fire in self-defence, causing three
casualties to the assailants.";;;;Monitor;;;;;;;;Implement;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

request, the local Commander of the Army of the Republic of Bosnia and
Herzegovina submitted information on two heavy weapons in his possession.
UNPROFOR patrols, however, later found four additional undeclared heavy weapons
(one anti-aircraft and three anti-tank weapons), which cast doubts on the
accuracy of the information originally provided [Operations_PatrolsInterventions: Implement, Demilitarization: Monitor]. Efforts continue to have the

had been cleared of heavy weapons, apart from 3 weapons that were found to be

opposing forces. Owing in part to delays in the arrival of the required
UNPROFOR forces, which were caused largely by factors beyond the control of
UNPROFOR, it took an additional day to complete the withdrawal of the main body
of Serb forces that had been attacking the town [Demilitarization: Implement].";;;;Implement;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

and on the urgent deployment of an UNPROFOR battalion in an area with a
3-kilometre radius from the centre of Gorazde (defined as the centre of the main

supervise and report on the observance of the cease-fire by both parties. In
addition, it was agreed that heavy weapons would be withdrawn, not later than
2200 hours GMT on 26 April 1994, out of an area with a 20-kilometre radius from
the centre of Gorazde (but inside the territory of Bosnia and Herzegovina) and
out of range, so as not to constitute a threat to the Gorazde safe area, without
prejudice to the procedures to be agreed subsequently in accordance with
paragraph 3 of resolution 913 (1994). The agreement also included a guarantee
of secure conditions for immediate medical evacuations from Gorazde and
provisions for complete freedom of movement for all personnel of UNPROFOR and
humanitarian organizations and for the immediate start of negotiations in good
faith on all military matters in order to reduce tensions, achieve
disengagement, create secure and peaceful conditions and provide for the
humanitarian needs of the civilian population. The agreement further indicated
that the implementation of the preceding measures would contribute to
intensifying efforts towards achieving an overall political settlement agreed by
all parties.";;;;Meeting,InternationalActor;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
UNPROFOR_S/1994/555_BiH;20;3104;"20. UNPROFOR is determined to continue its efforts to ensure delivery of
humanitarian assistance to civilians in need anywhere in Bosnia and Herzegovina,
and at the same time to facilitate the achievement of an overall political
solution to the conflict [HumanitarianRelief: MaterialSupport]. The Force has, however, limited resources to deal
with other vital tasks in addition to the safe areas. The most important of
these are the agreements in Sarajevo, the UNPAs, Mostar and central Bosnia and
Herzegovina. These agreements are central to the welfare of the majority of the
population, as well as to the furtherance of the peace process. Despite a
significant reduction in levels of conflict, there also remains the requirement
to escort humanitarian aid, which could increase at short notice, as well as the
introduction of new tasks in support of normalization and reconstruction. While
acknowledging that a narrow delineation of safe areas raises complex political
and legal questions, such a definition by UNPROFOR would be the only practical
and achievable one from the military point of view, given the nature of UNPROFOR
as a lightly armed, impartial, international force.";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;MaterialSupport;;;;
UNPROFOR_S/1994/555_BiH;15;3103;"15. In short, UNPROFOR found itself in a situation where many safe areas were
not safe, where their existence appeared to thwart only one army in the
conflict, thus jeopardizing UNPROFOR’s impartiality, and where UNPROFOR’s role
needed to be adequately defined in a manner that would be compatible with the
rest of its mandate. As a result of these problems, UNPROFOR has attempted to
redefine the safe-area concept in order to reduce ambiguity, enhance credibility
and even-handedness and improve the protection of civilians to the extent
possible with available resources [CivilianProtection: Implement].";;;;;;Implement;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
UNPROFOR_S/1994/555_BiH;13;3102;"13. The failure of the safe-area concept to protect the civilian population of
Gorazde has highlighted a number of problems, including the appalling living
conditions in these areas, their social and economic unviability and the fact
that the Army of Bosnia and Herzegovina has used the safe areas as locations in
which its troops can rest, train and equip themselves as well as fire at Serb
positions, thereby provoking Serb retaliation. A more detailed discussion of
these problems is contained in paragraphs 30 to 35 of my report of 16 March 1994
(S/1994/300). A number of additional points need to be further emphasized from
UNPROFOR’s point of view. First, UNPROFOR’s protection role is derived from its
mere presence: UNPROFOR is neither structured nor equipped for combat and has
never had sufficient resources, even with air support, to defend the safe areas
against a deliberate attack or to hold ground. Second, UNPROFOR’s humanitarian
and monitoring tasks in Bosnia and Herzegovina are not restricted solely to the
safe areas. They apply equally throughout the Republic. Experience since
June 1993 has shown that it is difficult to move troops from safe areas, once
the situation has stabilized, to more urgent tasks elsewhere. Safe areas have,
therefore, further restricted the flexibility that is needed when only limited
resources are available. Third, as previously stated, clearly defined
boundaries have not been agreed by the parties for Tuzla, Gorazde and
particularly Bihac, where there are special difficulties owing to an internal
conflict and the launching of indirect fire into the pocket from the United
Nations protected areas (UNPAs) in Croatia. Fourth, weapons collection sites
tie down scarce troops in static tasks, rather than in pro-active patrolling or
other protective measures. Further, it is apparent that the parties do not
believe that the weapons in the collection sites are intended to be inaccessible
to them: in Srebrenica, for example, the citizens have on a number of occasions
requested that weapons be returned and Serb forces in Sarajevo have temporarily
withdrawn weapons, during periods of increased tension, although they were
subsequently returned as a result of UNPROFOR pressure [Demilitarization: Advocate]. Finally, the use or
threat of use of air power in support of the safe areas has interrupted the
delivery of humanitarian assistance through areas controlled by the Bosnian
Serbs.";;;;Advocate;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
UNPROFOR_S/1994/555_BiH;9;3101;"9. From the outset, shortage of troops and the resultant inability to place
United Nations troops in the area, coupled with the unwillingness of the parties
to negotiate, made it impossible to achieve a specific safe-area agreement for
Gorazde or to delineate the boundaries of the area. UNPROFOR’s presence was
limited to no more than eight observers. As a result, UNPROFOR was in a
position only to observe when the Serb offensive on that area began in
March 1994 [Operations_UseofForce: Monitor]. When close air support was employed in defence of the endangered
United Nations personnel in Gorazde, the Bosnian Serbs reacted strongly by
detaining a large number of United Nations personnel and imposing major
obstructions to freedom of movement [HostilityOther: Physical]. After much effort on the part of UNPROFOR,
coupled with the further threat of NATO air strikes at the request of the
Secretary-General, an agreement was ultimately achieved between UNPROFOR and the
Bosnian Serb authorities for the withdrawal of all Serb forces from within a
3-kilometre zone, and of heavy weapons from within a 20-kilometre zone around
the centre of the town.";;;;;;;;;;;;;Monitor;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
UNPROFOR_S/1994/555_BiH;8;3100;"8. Following the agreement at Zepa, UNPROFOR attempted unsuccessfully to have
the parties reach a detailed safe-area agreement for Sarajevo. Only after the
tragic shelling of the Sarajevo market square, the letter sent by the Secretary-
General to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) on 6 February 1994 (see
S/1994/131, annex), and the resultant threat of NATO intervention, was it
possible to negotiate an agreement between the Bosnian government and Serb
forces whereby, on 9 February 1994, they agreed to the interpositioning of
UNPROFOR forces and the withdrawal out of range or placement under UNPROFOR
control of heavy weapons. On 10 February 1994, the North Atlantic Council
declared that non-compliance with the withdrawal of heavy weapons from a 20-
kilometre radius from the centre of Sarajevo would result in the initiation of
air strikes 10 days from that date. This facilitated implementation of the
agreement by the parties because of the added notion of enforcement by a
/...

credible third party. Ultimately, heavy weapons were either withdrawn or placed
under UNPROFOR control in a number of weapons-control sites [Demilitarization: Implement]. As a result of
this agreement, Sarajevo has been free from heavy-weapons attack.";;;;Implement;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
UNPROFOR_S/1994/555_BiH;7;3099;"7. In Srebrenica and Zepa, the concept has been applied with a greater degree
of effectiveness than in the other areas. In these two areas, the warring
parties agreed upon a cease-fire on the confrontation line, deployment of
UNPROFOR troops, medical evacuation, ad hoc demilitarization, freedom of
movement and other related measures. Although the implementation of these
agreements has been far from complete and has led to many problems, UNPROFOR has
been able to deploy troops on the ground. The presence of UNPROFOR troops in
these towns and their surroundings has served to enhance the security of the
population and to stabilize the situation in these areas [CivilianProtection: Implement (*This coding is based on the context provided in the previous paragraphs)]. Unfortunately, such
an agreement did not prove possible in respect of the other four safe areas.";;;;;;Implement;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
UNPROFOR_S/1994/300_BiH;41;3098;"41. In Bosnia and Herzegovina, UNPROFOR has kept Sarajevo airport open,
protected the delivery of humanitarian aid, monitored the interdiction of
flights (including effectively ending the use of the air for combat purposes),
improved conditions in Srebrenica, Zepa and Tuzla and to some extent deterred
major attacks on the safe areas [BiH: StateAdministration: MaterialSupport, HumanitarianRelief: ProvideSecurity, Demilitarization: Monitor]. It has also achieved the first cease-fire and
heavy-weapons disengagement in Sarajevo that appears to contain the potential
for a durable peace and brokered a similar agreement between Bosniac and Croat
forces. It has not, of course, ended the war in that strife-torn country, but
it has been neither mandated nor equipped to do that. While cease-fires remain
fragile, UNPROFOR needs more troops to ensure that minor incidents do not
escalate.";;;;Monitor;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;MaterialSupport;;;;;;;;;;;;ProvideSecurity;;;;
UNPROFOR_S/1994/300_Croatia;40;3097;"40. In Croatia, UNPROFOR has brought about the withdrawal of the JNA from
Croatian territory and the withdrawal of Croatian forces from territories
occupied by force in the attack of 9 September 1993 in the Medak pocket.
UNPROFOR’s presence has also been instrumental in reducing to some extent the
widespread and flagrant abuse of the human rights of minority populations in the
UNPAs [Croatia: HumanRights: Implement]. UNPROFOR’s work in coordination with humanitarian relief organizations
has provided relief to 110,000 beneficiaries in the UNPAs [Croatia: HumanitarianRelief: Implement with IA]. UNPROFOR achieved a
significant truce between the parties through a step-by-step approach at the
local level, which has held since November 1993 and has resulted in a
significant decrease in armed hostilities along the confrontation line in all
sectors except one area of Sector South. This has enabled other humanitarian
and confidence-building measures to be put in place in all four sectors,
including, for the first time in over a year, family reunion meetings, meetings
of local Red Cross organizations and face-to-face meetings between local
officials from both sides. However, the political conjuncture of the Serb
elections of December 1993 in the UNPAs, the Croatian-Serbian rapprochement of
January 1994, the Croatian-Bosniac agreement in Bosnia and Herzegovina and
tensions over renewal of UNPROFOR’s mandate has resulted in a dangerously tense
military situation and placed in jeopardy many of these local confidencebuilding
measures. Moreover, UNPROFOR has been unable, for the reasons
described earlier, to achieve the demilitarization of the UNPAs, the return of
refugees and displaced persons to their homes, the restoration of Croatian
authority in the UNPAs and the ""pink zones"", and the establishment of border
controls.";;;;;;;Implement;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;Implement,InternationalActor;;;;
UNPROFOR_S/1994/300_BiH;21;3096;"21. For much of this period, these have proved the dominant tasks, in terms of
time and resources expended, of UNPROFOR’s Bosnia and Herzegovina Command [HumanitarianRelief: MaterialSupport, ProvideSecurity with IA]. The
problems constraining the delivery of humanitarian assistance described in
document S/26470 of 20 September 1993 have increased. Convoys in central Bosnia
were suspended for four weeks from 25 October 1993 following a fatal attack on a
UNHCR convoy. On 18 and 29 November 1993, the three parties signed joint
declarations providing inter alia for security, freedom of movement and access
for humanitarian personnel and assistance. While some improvement in access for
non-food items was evident thereafter, the deliberate targeting of vehicles and
personnel continued, necessitating increased UNPROFOR protection. Access to
some areas remained severely restricted by obstruction (for example, Gorazde and
the Maglaj/Tesanj enclave) and the intensity of the conflict (for example,
East Mostar). The Bosnian Croats continued to deny clearance for critical
utilities, spare parts and supplies in the areas under their control. Finally,
secondary and tertiary distribution from UNHCR warehouses to recipients,
particularly in central Bosnia and Herzegovina, has been greatly reduced owing
/...

to the inability of local vehicles and drivers to cross confrontation lines.
Nevertheless, the provision of humanitarian assistance, the resilience of the
population and a second relatively mild winter have to date prevented
large-scale malnutrition and mitigated the worst effects of the breakdown in
essential services. The contribution of UNPROFOR has been vital in this regard.";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;MaterialSupport,ProvideSecurity,InternationalActor;;;;

that the objectives described in subparagraph 18 (d) above were fully
accomplished only in February 1994. Prior to that, one aircraft was shot down
while approaching Sarajevo airport in August 1992 and several others sustained
minor damage from small-arms fire. None the less, since the airport was opened
under UNPROFOR control on 3 July 1992, more than 8,200 flights have landed in
Sarajevo, carrying some 95,000 tons of humanitarian relief. Although Sarajevo
airport has had to be closed temporarily for security reasons on numerous
occasions, it has largely remained open and provides a vital lifeline to and

UNPROFOR on 1 March 1994 established an Interim Coordination Body to act as a
temporary focal point for the various organizations currently operating in
Sarajevo in the restoration of essential services as well as for those offering
their assistance henceforth [StateAdministration, HumanitarianRelief: Implement with IA]. The initial outcome will be a comprehensive status
report, taking stock of and assessing past and current activities to restore
public services in Sarajevo, which would provide the basis for the plan of
action requested in paragraph 3 of Security Council resolution 900 (1994). In
this context, ""essential public services"" have been identified as public health,
shelter, water, energy, public transport, communications, education and

routes, not only in the immediate vicinity of Sarajevo but also throughout
Bosnia and Herzegovina. The main lifeline to Sarajevo is the road from Ploce on
the Adriatic coast via Mostar, Jablanica and Konjic. Hitherto, this route has
been blocked by the Bosnian Serb ring around Sarajevo as well as by the Bosnian
Croat (HVO) forces as a result of the conflict between the forces of the Bosnian
Government and the HVO [HostilityOther: Physical]. Following the cease-fire agreement signed on
23 February 1994 at Camp Pleso, UNPROFOR has initiated measures to take control
of this major access road as well as other roads essential for the delivery of
humanitarian assistance in Bosnia and Herzegovina [HumanitarianRelief: MaterialSupport]. The parties to this
agreement have so far generally respected their undertakings. Moreover, the
ongoing negotiations relating to the establishment of a Federation involving the
Bosnian Muslim and Croat communities augur well for continued compliance with
the cease-fire agreement. After months of intensive fighting, however, the
improvement in relations between the two sides at the local level is tenuous at
best and needs to be consolidated by confidence-building measures such as those
provided for in the agreement.";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;MaterialSupport;;;;

related to effective compliance with the cease-fire arrangements and the
measures relating to heavy weapons. The main impediments to movement inside the
city have been continued sniper activity and constant shelling. UNPROFOR’s
/...
S/1994/291

deployment along the confrontation lines has already significantly reduced
sniper activity. Apart from the measures to control heavy weapons [Demilitarization: Implement], the
deployment of mortar and artillery locating radars in Sarajevo in connection
with the threat to use air power against any mortar or artillery position firing
against the city has contributed significantly to the effective end of the
shelling of Sarajevo. UNPROFOR is also in the process of addressing the issue
of the numerous checkpoints that obstruct access to the city [HostilityOther: Physical].";;;;Implement;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
UNPROFOR_S/1994/291_BiH;11;3089;"11. UNPROFOR has carefully analysed the tasks involved in consolidating the
cease-fire in and around Sarajevo and in ensuring the freedom of movement of the
civilian population and of humanitarian goods, and has come to the conclusion
that 22 mechanized infantry companies are needed for the task. At present
UNPROFOR has 11 companies at its disposal in the area concerned and therefore
needs to be reinforced without delay by 11 more companies (some 2,400 all
ranks), that is, two or three mechanized infantry battalions, depending on their
configuration and strength, self-sufficient with support and logistics units.
Because of the flexible and mobile deployment necessitated by the multi-role
approach of interposing at confrontation lines, controlling heavy weapons
collection sites, as well as patrolling and monitoring the 20-kilometre
exclusion zone, improving the logistics capability of UNPROFOR has become a
matter of utmost urgency [Demilitarization: Implement, Monitor, Operations_PatrolsInterventions: Implement]. In addition to the above requirements, UNPROFOR
would, therefore, need to be augmented further by logistic and support units of
2,200 all ranks. These units should include one logistics battalion (1,000 all
ranks), one engineer battalion (500 all ranks), one special reconnaissance
squadron (150 all ranks), one helicopter squadron (150 all ranks, with six armed
helicopters) and eight indirect fire locating units (50 all ranks each).
Moreover, UNPROFOR would need an additional 100 United Nations military
observers in order to permit the military observers redeployed from the United
Nations protected areas in Croatia to return to their original functions. To
implement the tasks in and around Sarajevo thus requires a total of
4,600 troops. Taking into account the 2,400 troops already authorized by the
Security Council in its resolution 844 (1993) but not yet deployed in theatre,
UNPROFOR’s authorized strength would have to be increased by 2,200 all ranks.";;;;Monitor,Implement;;;;;;;;Implement;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

characterized by a mixture of achievements and setbacks. UNPROFOR has been
successful in carrying out its mission in those areas where the parties have
been willing to demonstrate good faith in implementing agreements and where the
international community has provided a clear political context within which the
mission can operate. A good example of the benefits of peace-keeping can be
seen in UNPROFOR’s achievements in the Federation, where considerable human
resources have been devoted to building peace and enhancing tolerance and
reconciliation between the parties through a variety of concrete measures
designed to create conditions of normality for the general population. The
facilitation of mutually beneficial joint economic projects to improve living
conditions in central and southern Bosnia and Herzegovina has helped to lay a
foundation of confidence and trust among a population that had previously
witnessed some of the most intense fighting in the present conflict [EconomicDevelopment: Assist].";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;Assist;;;;;

reached on a mandate comprising the above elements, I must stress that crucial
differences remain between the Government of Croatia and the Krajina Serb
authorities with regard to the nature, size and functions of the force in the
zone of separation and in the United Nations protected areas. In particular,
the deployment patterns (e.g., fixed posts or mobile patrols or a combination of
the two) and mode of functioning (e.g., monitor and report, as opposed to stop
and search) of the United Nations force in the zone of separation and on the
international borders require further discussion. In this connection, it is
pertinent to recall that UNPROFOR is already deployed in a monitoring function
in the border areas, where it currently maintains 37 observation posts and
9 crossing-points with the cooperation of the local Krajina Serb authorities [BorderControl: Monitor].
Depending on the tasks finally agreed upon in the new mandate, a reduction from
present troop levels would be possible, but it should be recognized that the
capacity of the Force to react to developments would be commensurately lessened.";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;Monitor;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

UNPROFOR_S/1995/222_Macedonia;44;3083;"44. UNPROFOR’s mission to monitor and report along the former Yugoslav Republic
of Macedonia’s borders with the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and
Montenegro) and Albania reveals no current military threat [BorderControl: Monitor]. Since my last
report, however, there has been no decisive move towards establishing a clear
international border between the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and the
Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro). Following incidents in
the area of the disputed border between the two countries in the summer of 1994,
UNPROFOR negotiated a military administrative boundary between the two parties
that determines the northern limit of the area of operation for UNPROFOR troops.
Although neither Government acknowledges the military administrative boundary as
a legitimate international border, both sides use it for the reporting and
management of border-crossing incidents. While UNPROFOR has monitored military
patrols from both countries crossing the boundary, it has observed no tension
between the sides [Operations_PatrolsInterventions, BorderControl: Monitor with IA]. However, the potential for confrontation still exists in the

UNPROFOR_S/1995/222_BiH;34;3082;"34. As described in my last report to the Council, serious violations of human
rights have persisted in Bosnia and Herzegovina, particularly in Bosnian
Serb-controlled territory. Recently, UNHCR has reported on a new wave of
attacks against minorities in the Banja Luka area, in which Muslim houses have
been systematically robbed and their occupants terrorized. In pursuance of
relevant Security Council resolutions and presidential statements, and in line
with the implementation of the human rights aspects of the cessation-ofhostilities
agreement, UNPROFOR has repeatedly sought, without success, the
deployment of civil affairs and civilian police monitors into areas controlled
by the Bosnian Serbs. During a visit of the UNPROFOR Head of Civil Affairs to
Banja Luka with a team of civil affairs officers on 21 and 22 January 1995, the
question of the protection of minorities was raised with the Banja Luka
authorities [HumanRights: Monitor]. Despite assurances received from the Bosnian Serbs that civil
affairs officers could continue making visits to Banja Luka and the Doboj
regions, the Bosnian Serbs, on 25 February, demanded the removal of UNPROFOR’s
recently installed civil affairs presence in Banja Luka [HostilityOther: Physical]. (UNPROFOR has since
received assurances that future visits will be allowed, on certain conditions.)
Around the same time, the UNPROFOR Civilian Police Commissioner was informed of
the Bosnian Serbs’ objection to the deployment of civilian police monitors on
their territory. Some progress has, however, been made with an agreement for
the establishment of a Civil Affairs Office in the Serb-controlled area of
Grbavica in Sarajevo.

UNPROFOR_S/1995/222_BiH;30;3080;"30. In contrast to the difficulties in achieving full implementation of the
cessation-of-hostilities agreement in some areas, substantial progress has been
achieved in improving relations between the Bosniac and Bosnian Croat parties in
the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Now one year old, the Federation
demonstrates that, with the assistance of the international community, former
adversaries can stop fighting and cooperate on questions of mutual political,
economic and humanitarian benefit. Throughout the contiguous territory of the
Federation, UNPROFOR has played a major role in supporting the peace process.
UNPROFOR battalions have monitored the cease-fire of February 1994 and the
buffer zone between the parties, overseen the separation of forces and
controlled heavy weapons through the establishment of weapons collections points
and active sites [Demilitarization: Implement]. In Mostar, through agreement reached with the European Union
Administration of that city, UNPROFOR has monitored the process of
demilitarization and provided a secure environment for the Administration to
operate [Demilitarization: Monitor]. UNPROFOR battalions have also provided human resources for the
restoration of infrastructure [StateAdministration: Implement]. Roads and bridges have been rebuilt by UNPROFOR.,
water, sewage, and telephone systems have been repaired with UNPROFOR’s
assistance [StateAdministration: Implement]. The results are impressive. Power lines have been restored to over
90 per cent of the villages in the Federation territory. Electricity production
has increased by at least 50 per cent. Thousands of people have been able to
move freely through UNPROFOR-controlled checkpoints. However, problems persist
in relations between the two communities, particularly in respect of freedom of
movement between territories controlled by each party, and tensions have arisen
that continue to require the vigilant efforts of the international community.";;;;Monitor,Implement;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;Implement;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

activities, including assisting UNHCR and other agencies in the transport and
distribution of humanitarian aid, protecting minorities in the United Nations
protected areas, and in seeking to develop humanitarian confidence-building
measures [HumanitarianRelief: Implement, MaterialSupport with IA, CivilianProtection: Implement]. In Sector North, UNPROFOR’s role was vital in helping UNHCR to assist
30,000 refugees from the Bihac pocket who fled into the sector in August and did
not return to Velika Kladusa until the end of December 1994 [RefugeeAssistance: Implement with IA]. Similarly,
UNPROFOR committed substantial resources in support of UNHCR to protect and
assist some 15,000 refugees expelled from the Banja Luka area during their
transit through Sector West, pending their admission to refugee centres by the
Croatian authorities [RefugeeAssistance: MaterialSupport with IA].";;;;;;Implement;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;MaterialSupport,Implement,InternationalActor;;MaterialSupport,Implement,InternationalActor;;

Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) have
continued to assist in facilitating the voluntary return of displaced people to
their homes in those areas where return can take place in conditions of security
and dignity, and in accordance with humanitarian principles [RefugeeAssistance: Implement with IA]. They have also
acted as a catalyst to mobilize assistance from other organizations and
coordinate their efforts in this regard. The security situation along the zone
of separation has improved and stabilized under the cease-fire agreement to the
extent that several thousand displaced persons have returned to their homes of
their own volition. However, large-scale returns have not been possible in the
absence of substantial progress towards a political settlement. It would,
moreover, have been contrary to international humanitarian law and practice for
the United Nations to encourage returns to areas that remained insecure as a
result of high levels of hostility or widespread mine-infestation, and where the
human rights of minorities could not be guaranteed.";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;Implement,InternationalActor;;

were instrumental in setting up working-level meetings, arranging for exchanges
of technical documents, conducting technical inspections and developing concepts
of operations for 12 water and electricity rehabilitation projects [StateAdministration: Implement]. On the
basis of technical inspections, it was estimated that, with full cooperation
from both sides and moderate additional financial resources, the Petrinje-Sisak
waterworks could have been fully restored by the end of February 1995, the
Okucani railway could have been operational by 31 March 1995, and towns along
the Dalmatian coast, including Zadar and Biograd, would have had adequate water
supplies by this summer for the first time in four years.

negotiating process between the parties and the implementation of the economic
agreement. Since 21 December 1994, over 200,000 vehicles have used the
Zagreb-Lipovac highway, bringing substantial personal and economic improvements
to both sides, with only a few sporadic incidents marring safe passage for
increasing numbers of travellers. One hundred and forty UNCIVPOL monitors have
conducted over 2,500 patrols along the highway, which is also protected in UNPA
Sector West by 125 UNPROFOR military personnel [Operations_PatrolsInterventions: Implement]. On 20 January 1995, the
generator poles of the Obrovac hydroelectric station were returned to the Serb
side, an essential step towards the restoration of electricity production in the
area. On 26 January 1995, the oil pipeline was opened through UNPA Sector
North, creating the possibility of significant revenue for Croatia from the
transshipment of oil to Central European customers. On 27 January 1995, the
first meeting of the Economic Joint Commission, co-chaired by representatives
from the International Conference on the Former Yugoslavia and UNPROFOR, took
place in Knin and agreed on the accelerated implementation of key economic
projects, including the Zagreb-Okucani railway, on which mine-clearing
operations commenced on 4 February 1995 [EconomicDevelopment, StateAdministration: Meeting with IA].

apprehension of residents in and near the zone of separation, particularly the
minorities in the United Nations protected areas (UNPAs). Some 28,000 Croats
are estimated to have remained in the areas, and approximately 5,000 Serbs live
in the Croatian-administered section of UNPA Sector West. It should be noted
that UNPROFOR has played a major role in protecting the rights of minorities in
the protected areas and the Croat population there has been relatively stable
since the cease-fire agreement, with fewer than 100 Croats seeking assistance to
depart to Croatian-administered territory, mainly for family or medical reasons [CivilianProtection: Implement].
While UNPROFOR has been successful in reducing crimes against minorities, it has
been approached recently by hundreds of Croats requesting their immediate
transfer to Croatian-administered areas should UNPROFOR depart.";;;;;;Implement;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

most in need of humanitarian help and to ensure its delivery to them. A joint
humanitarian cell has been established, for instance, in Sector North, bringing
together all elements of UNPROFOR, together with the Office of the United
Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), the European Community
Monitoring Mission (ECMM) and the International Committee of the Red Cross
(ICRC), in order to identify the most needy in terms, especially, of food and
medical aid [HumanitarianRelief: Monitor, MaterialSupport with IA]. UNCIVPOL and the battalions are now heavily engaged in identifying
and assisting those in greatest need. Comparable endeavours are under way in
the other sectors.

largest remaining concentration of Croats in Sector South, UNPROFOR has managed
to stabilize a situation which had begun to deteriorate rapidly after the
September 1993 incursion by the Croatian Army into the Medak pocket and the
atrocities committed there. A full company of the Czech battalion has been
deployed in this group of hamlets in the hills above Korenica, a United Nations
Civilian Police (UNCIVPOL) station has been opened, and senior UNPROFOR
officials have visited frequently, also sensitizing the Serb authorities to the
need to provide protection [Operations_UseofForce: Monitor]. Comparable activities have occurred in some other
areas.

taken a number of other steps on the military side to enhance cooperation and
reduce tensions, including the opening of several new crossing-points and the
enhancement of UNPROFOR’s border-monitoring capability [BorderControl: Monitor]. They have managed to

achieving local cease-fires. These range from a signed, formal cease-fire
agreement in Sector East to ""gentlemen’s agreements"" - oral and unsigned, but
implemented - in the other three sectors, in each of which discussions are
continuing towards formal agreements. Sector East exemplifies the step-by-step
approach, in that a local cease-fire was first signed and implemented and was
then followed by the establishment of local joint commissions to investigate
violations. With these first steps in place, the Sector Commander has now
proposed to each side the creation of zones of separation between their forces.
Such local cease-fires have, in each sector, been supported by the establishment
of new observation posts, additional patrols by United Nations military
observers [Operations_PatrolsInterventions: Implement], and the installation of hot lines with, and between, the two sides.
The consequence of this has been a discernible reduction in tension and
violations throughout the United Nations protected areas.";;;;;;;;;;;;Implement;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

protected areas and ""pink zones"", and rising tension in Croatia, shelling
intensified on both sides of the confrontation line, and the Croatian Army once
again effected a military incursion. This took place in the area of Medak,
where three Serb villages were seized. The hostilities worsened on 10 and
11 September, with a serious escalation in the military means employed: the
Croatian Government used aircraft to bomb Serb positions, and the Serbs fired
rockets and heavy missiles at Croatian population centres. Following the
intervention of my Special Representative and the Force Commander, and a call
from the Security Council (S/26436), the parties finally agreed to a cease-fire
on 15 September. Croatian withdrawal to positions occupied before this
incursion has begun after some delay, and UNPROFOR is moving some 500 to 600
troops into the area to replace the withdrawing Croatian armed forces. Efforts
to restore the shipboard meeting, postponed as a result of the hostilities, are

13 July 1993 (S/26099). The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia command of
UNPROFOR, led by Brigadier-General Finn Saermark-Thomsen of Denmark, now
consists of 1,190 military, civilian and police personnel. A Nordic battalion
is based at Kjojila, east of Skopje, and a United States contingent of 315
troops arrived in Skopje in early July, deploying to the former Yugoslav
Republic of Macedonia side of the border with the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia
(Serbia and Montenegro) on 20 August 1993. United Nations military observers,
United Nations civilian police (UNCIVPOL) and civil affairs officers have also
been deployed. Since early 1993 the northern border and the western border
north of Debar have been constantly monitored from observation posts and by
regular patrols [BorderControl: Monitor, Operations_PatrolsInterventions: Implement]. United Nations military observers and civilian police also
mount regular patrols in their areas of operation. UNPROFOR maintains close
cooperation in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia with the Conference on
Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE) monitor mission there. It now also,
in cooperation with the authorities in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia
and CSCE’s sanctions assistance mission, monitors traffic crossing the border

The Serbs have failed to demilitarize the UNPAs as called for in Security

of resolutions 762 (1992) (return of the ""pink zones"" to Croatian authority) and
769 (1992) (control of the borders of the UNPAs). They have also imposed
restrictions on UNPROFOR’s freedom of movement [HostilityOther: Physical], especially in Sector South,
which have crippled UNPROFOR’s monitoring function [Demilitarization: Monitor]. The Croatian side, in turn,
has manifested its impatience with the United Nations by three times (June 1992,

quickly reversed, the situation may deteriorate further. The position of
minority groups, which was tending to stabilize both inside and outside the
UNPAs, has worsened since the events of 22 January 1993. Remaining Croats in
the UNPAs have in many cases been relentlessly persecuted, suffering murder,
assault, threats, armed thefts and arson. UNPROFOR has had to establish
protected villages and, in the last resort, was forced to help relocate several
hundred vulnerable civilians to security in Croatia with the cooperation, and
sometimes at the insistence, of the Croatian Government [CivilianProtection: Assist, Implement]. It has been a tragic

UNPAs where terrorist methods such as physical abuse, coercion, harassment ad
even killings, have been used to force non-Serb families to leave their
homes. In earlier cases, especially before UNPROFOR's assumption of
responsibility, these expulsions were carried out in a blatant manner., families were, under physical threat, gathered from their houses in buses and trucks and transported to areas outside the UNPAs. This had been most evident in Sector East. Since assuming its responsibilities, UNPROFOR has been able,
as a result of intense patrolling and control at checkpoints, to put a stop to
mass expulsions [Operations_PatrolsInterventions, CivilianProtection: Implement (Although no reference to ""civilian protection,"" I coded so as protection of individuals from expulsion by armed forces, in my view, amounts to civilian protection.)], individual cases of intimidation resulting in the forced
departure of persons from their homes have, however, continued to occur and

ongoing for the drawdown of UNMIT’s police and military personnel as well as its
civilian personnel, in consultation with the Government. As mentioned in the above
section on the transition process (see paras. 59-63), it is projected that UNMIT
police will end operational support to PNTL by 31 October [PoliceReform: AssistOther]. Following the planned
UNMIT police reduction, out of the 1,149 officers deployed as at 20 September (see
para. 21 above), it is currently expected that approximately 70 police officers will
leave in October, 540 in November and 30 in December. In addition, it is planned
that UNMIT’s formed police units will be withdrawn during the two weeks
following the end of operational support to PNTL, with the Malaysian, Bangladeshi,
Portuguese and Pakistani units due to leave on 8, 10, 12 and 14 November
respectively. Corresponding to the reduction of respective Mission activities during
the remaining mandate period through December, it is planned that UNMIT’s
international civilian personnel (totalling 332 as at 20 September) will be reduced
by approximately 59 staff in October, 81 in November and 132 in December, with
about 67 staff to be retained for the liquidation team.

UNMIT_S/2012/765;70;2941;"70. As expressed during my recent visit, Timor-Leste has made impressive
advances during the decade since the restoration of its independence, particularly
since the crisis in 2006, which led to the establishment of UNMIT, and my visit to
the country in December 2007 (see S/2008/26, paras. 13-14). In 2010, the United
Nations technical assessment mission noted that the country had recovered from the
2006 crisis insofar as the immediate challenges had been resolved (see S/2010/85,
paras. 21 and 22), including with stability and security restored, the return of about
150,000 internally displaced persons and the closure of all tented camps, and the
gradual reintegration of the dismissed F-FDTL “petitioners” into civilian life. The
security situation has remained calm and stable since the first post-2006 test of the
attacks on the President and the Prime Minister on 11 February 2008 (see
S/2008/501, paras. 3 and 4). PNTL exercised responsibility for the conduct of all
police operations in Timor-Leste in the past 18 months, and the reported crime rate
has remained low, with UNMIT police focusing on further institutional development
and capacity-building while providing operational support in certain areas (see
para. 21 above) [PoliceReform: AssistOther].";;;;;;;;;;Assist,AssistOther;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

transition, UNMIT entered into an innovative partnership with four United Nations
country team members (UNDP, UNFPA, UNICEF and UN-Women) to carry out
particular mandated activities from July to December 2012, with UNMIT financial
support and arrangements set out in memorandums of understanding. These
partnership arrangements, which relate to activities set out in the Integrated
Strategic Framework for Timor-Leste 2011-2012 in the medium-term strategy
priority areas of ensuring security and stability, rule of law, justice and human
rights, a culture of democratic governance and dialogue, and socioeconomic
development, are also in line with my initiative on civilian capacity in the aftermath
of conflict (see A/66/311-S/2011/527 and A/67/312-S/2012/645) [JusticeSectorReform, HumanRights, DemocraticInstitutions, EconomicDevelopment: Implement with IA]. On 22 February,
former President Ramos-Horta and Chair of the United Nations Development
Group, Helen Clark, co-chaired a Member States consultation on Timor-Leste,
moderated by my former Special Representative, Ameerah Haq, with representatives
of the Permanent Missions to the United Nations as well as United Nations
agencies, funds and programmes and various departments. At the event, the Minister
of Finance presented a portfolio of 34 United Nations country team projects,
formulated together with the Government, in support of the consolidation of peace
S/2012/765

in Timor-Leste following UNMIT’s planned departure. The portfolio covers a threeyear
period (2012-2014) and requires total funding of approximately $76 million, or
$25.3 million per year. Since the Member States consultation, the Government and
United Nations agencies, funds and programmes have appealed to Member States to
provide funding for the portfolio projects.";;;;;;;Implement,InternationalActor;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;Implement,InternationalActor;;;;;;;;;;Implement,InternationalActor;;;;;

collaborate and make further progress on the transition process, including in the
context of the High-level Committee on Transition (see S/2012/43, para. 51), which
held meetings on 2 February, 27 April, 10 August (just two days after the formation
of the new Government) and 20 September (see para. 60 below). At the 10 August
meeting, chaired by President Taur Matan Ruak and attended by the Vice-Prime
Minister, the President of Parliament, various Government ministers and
representatives, the PNTL General Commander, the F-FDTL Commander and my
Acting Special Representative and the UNMIT senior management team, the
Committee reviewed progress in the implementation of the Joint Transition Plan in
S/2012/765
12-53815 19
each of its focus areas. In conveying continued commitment to the Joint Transition
Plan mechanism, the Government confirmed its new focal points for the seven
transition focus areas. With respect to the policing area, the PNTL General
Commander and UNMIT Police Commissioner gave a presentation on the status of
implementation of the activities under the PNTL-UNMIT Police Joint Development
Plan (see paras. 21, 24 and 25 above) and discussed the ongoing process to facilitate
preparation for certification of the full reconstitution of PNTL as well as the
UNMIT police drawdown plan and the projected end of operational support to
PNTL by 31 October (see para. 28 above) [PoliceReform: Meeting]. The monitoring of the Joint Transition
Plan for the April-June 2012 quarter showed continued good progress in the
implementation of activities, with 83 per cent of the Plan’s 129 activities
progressing as planned and activities, on average, 68 per cent completed as at
30 June. On behalf of the Government, the Minister for Foreign Affairs indicated
that a team had been established comprising staff from the Government, the Office
of the President and Parliament to review the options for post-UNMIT arrangements
included in the Joint Transition Plan and to come to a joint position.";;;;;;;;;;Meeting;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
UNMIT_S/2012/765;50;2938;"50. As reflected above, further progress was made towards meeting the objectives
and benchmarks of the medium-term strategy in the areas of rule of law, justice and
human rights. However, additional efforts are particularly needed to address
challenges relating to accountability mechanisms, traditional justice and the
implementation of certain laws. Justice sector accountability mechanisms need to be
further strengthened, including through efforts to enhance the work of the Superior
Councils for the Judiciary, the Public Prosecution Service and the Public Defender,
and of the Management and Discipline Council for the Practice of Law. The
development of codes of conduct for judges, prosecutors, public defenders and
private lawyers is pending. As regards the benchmark for a legal framework which
takes into account traditional justice mechanisms that adhere to basic principles of
the administration of justice and human rights standards, the reconciliation of
traditional and formal justice systems will require more time to address, particularly
in terms of handling domestic and gender-based violence. Implementation of certain
key laws, such as the Law against Domestic Violence, as well as related monitoring
mechanisms, could be enhanced. Considering that investigations into 85 outstanding
cases of serious crimes had not been completed by the Serious Crimes Investigation
Team as at 20 September (see para. 44 above) [TransitionalJustice: Monitor] and that it is projected that, by the
end of the mandate on 31 December, about 20 additional cases will be completed,
the related benchmark will not be met by December 2012.";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;Monitor;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
UNMIT_S/2012/765;49;2937;"49. Improving access to justice for all segments of the population remains one of
the major challenges in the sector. The limited number of public defenders, lack of a
comprehensive legal aid regulatory framework and lack of availability of donor
funding for legal aid services beyond August (with discussions ongoing as at
20 September) have hindered access, particularly for the most vulnerable groups.
Continued training courses for judges, prosecutors, public defenders and private
lawyers and other efforts by the Legal Training Centre, supported by UNDP, have
helped to address human resources-related capacity gaps, including with the
graduation of the first seven private lawyers on 4 July. However, the Centre itself
still faces considerable constraints, including as regards human resources and
technical and strategic management capacities, resulting in continued dependence
on international personnel for certain expertise. Continued support for strengthening
national expertise and capacities is thus required. With the support of UNMIT and
UNFPA, various initiatives were undertaken to enhance access to justice for victims
of domestic and gender-based violence and strengthen accountability for such
crimes, such as the integration of gender-based violence investigative skills in the
curriculum of the Police Training Centre and a related two-week training course for
PNTL officers (30 May to 12 June), as well as the launching of a manual for legal
aid lawyers on addressing gender-based violence in Timor-Leste [JusticeSectorReform: AssistOther with IA, SexualViolence: Assist with IA, PoliceReform: AssistAgents with IA]. To facilitate
enhanced public confidence in the formal justice system, the Ministry of Justice
placed greater focus on public outreach and advocacy, including through a UNDPsupported
series of justice-related broadcasts on UNMIT’s weekly radio programme
and a number of “Taking justice to the people” outreach sessions in various
communities [JusticeSectorReform: Outreach, AssistOther with IA].";;;;;;;;;InternationalActor,Assist;Assist,AssistAgents,InternationalActor;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Human Rights Council adopted the outcome of the universal periodic review on
Timor-Leste (see A/HRC/DEC/19/115., S/2012/43, para. 35). The Government of
Timor-Leste accepted, inter alia, recommendations to ratify additional international
human rights treaties and to report on the status of implementation of treaties already
ratified. On 21 June, the Special Rapporteur on extreme poverty and human rights
presented the report on her mission to Timor-Leste (13-18 November 2011) to the
Human Rights Council, with recommendations for the country to focus on
implementing social and economic policies that ensure inclusive and equitable growth

legal framework, improving access to justice, education, health and land rights, and
strengthening the social protection system (A/HRC/20/25/Add.1., see S/2012/43,

presented the report on its visit to Timor-Leste (7-14 February 2011) to the Human
Rights Council (A/HRC/19/58/Add.1). In the report, the Working Group acknowledged
the many efforts that Timor-Leste had made since its independence despite the
challenges it faced, including in bringing about a process of national reconciliation,
but considered that more remained to be done to achieve the right to truth, justice and
reparation for those who disappeared and their families. In March and June 2012, the
Government of Timor-Leste made statements to the Human Rights Council regarding

management are still being prepared by the Office of the Secretary of State for
Security (ibid., para. 28), with UNMIT technical support [LegalReform, BorderControl: Assist]. The submitted draft
Decree-Law on the Regime of Private Security, which regulates private security
activity and provides a regime of enforcement and sanctions, was approved by the
Council of Ministers on 15 February but was not promulgated by the President
owing to the absence of an organic law on the National Directorate for the Security
of Public Buildings, which provides oversight of private security companies. With
continuing support from the UNMIT/UNDP project on strengthening civilian
oversight and management capacity in the security sector (ibid., para. 29) and
UNMIT police, a draft organic law was developed to define the structure and
functions of the Directorate, which is under review by the Office of the Secretary of
State for Security. With project support, the Government also established and
equipped the National Centre for Operational Coordination on 29 August, which
will lead the coordination of fire and rescue operations. Further, UNMIT provided
training to personnel of the PNTL, F-FDTL and a number of Directorates under the
responsibility of the Secretariat of State for Security in areas relating to the rule of
law, human rights and legislative frameworks [PoliceReform, MilitaryReform: AssistAgents, HumanRights, LegalReform: Assist]. At a ceremony on 3 May, the

additional bases established prior to the presidential election [MilitaryReform, ElectoralSecurity: AssistAgents]. F-FDTL was deployed
in 9 of the 13 districts during the election period to provide an additional sense of
security. As at 20 September, F-FDTL officers remained at those bases to perform
civil-military cooperation tasks. UNMIT military liaison officers also assisted in the
preparation of two F-FDTL officers to be deployed as military observers to the

training on 1 March. When they complete training in December 2012, the number of
PNTL officers will increase to 3,386, including 598 women. Despite the lower
number of women selected in the recent round of elections, Timor-Leste continues
to have one of the highest percentages of women police officers (18 per cent) in the
Asia-Pacific region, which is also important in view of the high rate of reported
domestic and sexual violence requiring interaction with women victims (see
para. 18 above). On International Women’s Day on 8 March, the PNTL and UNMIT
police held a ceremony to recognize the role and achievements of women officers in
Timor-Leste’s policing efforts [PoliceReform, Gender: Outreach]. Further, PNTL continued to make contributions to
United Nations missions in other parts of the world, with two officers serving with

General Commander and the UNMIT Police Commissioner established, by a joint
directive, a Working Group on Certification comprising PNTL and UNMIT police
personnel on 21 June to facilitate the process [PoliceReform: AssistPolicies]. As set out in the directive, the
Working Group was tasked to evaluate and report on the following three agreed
criteria for certification: (a) PNTL’s continued exercise of responsibility for police
operations, including adequate responses to any public order incidents since the
March 2011 resumption., (b) whether the remaining gaps and weaknesses identified
in the joint assessments of all districts and units (ibid.) are being addressed through
the implementation of the necessary arrangements, including through concentrated
training and capacity-building activities outlined in the PNTL-UNMIT Police Joint
Development Plan., and (c) continued and identifiable progress in the five agreed
major areas of the aforementioned Plan (see para. 24 above). In connection with this
process, the Working Group was also tasked to present a joint report and
recommendations to the PNTL General Commander and the UNMIT Police
Commissioner. In undertaking its evaluation, the Working Group followed an
approved workplan and conducted interviews based on a questionnaire given to
PNTL District and Subdistrict Commanders and Section Chiefs as well as UNMIT
Police District Commanders, and performed on-site inspections, record checks and
document reviews in all 13 districts in order to complement the received

UNMIT_S/2011/32;16;2843;"16. Since the development of the medium-term strategy in February 2009 (see
S/2009/72, para. 47), there has been some progress towards the objectives and
benchmarks relating to a culture of democratic governance and dialogue. The
establishment of the Civil Service Commission in August 2009 was a positive step
towards the creation of an effective civil service. The Government has further
developed its capacity to utilize local media to reach out to communities in order to
explain its policies and programmes, and increased efforts have been made by most
ministries to engage with the media. The Government has also increased its
development expenditure in the districts, although there remains a limited capacity
among district-based civil servants and community leaders to implement and
monitor public expenditure. Further, the Parliament continued to exercise oversight
over Government activities, with the Fretilin opposition actively participating in and
S/2011/32
6 11-21259
contributing to parliamentary debates. Perhaps the most prominent indicator of
long-term stability and recovery of Timor-Leste from the events of 2006 will be a
peaceful electoral process in 2012. While this will require that the national elections
be credible and transparent, successful elections alone will not guarantee democratic
governance. An understanding of, and respect for, the checks and balances among
the four pillars of sovereignty have yet to become firmly entrenched. As noted
above (see para. 3), concerns also exist over the possibility of growing corruption,
although the first audit report by the Court of Appeal and the establishment of the
Anti-Corruption Commission point to a gradual increase in institutional capacities
to combat corruption. In this context, UNMIT has continued to provide legal and
policy advice and support to the Commission [DemocraticInstitutions: Assist].";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;Assist;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

further opportunities for citizens to interact with their national leaders [DemocraticInstitutions: Outreach]. The forums
focused on issues relating to natural-resource management, veterans and the
Millennium Development Goals., participants included members of Parliament, civil
servants and representatives of the media and civil society [Resources: Outreach, Media, CivilSocietyAssistance: Implement]. The Civil Service
Commission developed a policy on the conversion of temporary civil service staff to
permanent status, which was approved by the Council of Ministers on 13 October.
Of the approximately 50 per cent of civil servants currently on temporary contracts
(some 13,000), 31 per cent are women. The Civil Service Commission also
developed, with UNDP support, a personnel management information system to
facilitate informed decision-making and career planning for civil servants.";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;Outreach;;;Outreach;;;;;Implement;Implement;;;;;;;;;

amendments to the laws on presidential elections, parliamentary elections and the
electoral management bodies. Those amendments have been submitted to the
Parliament for approval and are expected to be debated early in 2011. Once
promulgated, they will allow for the organization of elections, currently planned for
2012. UNMIT and UNDP continued to support the electoral management bodies
(the National Electoral Commission and the Technical Secretariat for Electoral
Administration) in consolidating institutional capacities so as to be able to conduct
future elections with less international support than had been required for the 2007
national elections (see para. 64) [ElectionAssistance: Assist with IA]. In particular, support was provided to the exercise
conducted in December aimed at updating the voter registration list and in the
context of various training programmes with political parties focused on fostering
women’s participation in the electoral process as both candidates and voters [VoterEducation, Gender, PartyAssistance: Assist with IA]. In
response to the 1 October letter from the Director of the Technical Secretariat for

the Maternus Bere case (see S/2009/504, para. 33), reparations for victims of human
rights violations committed between 1974 and 1999, and prosecution of serious
crimes committed in 1999. President Ramos-Horta cited the good bilateral
relationship with Indonesia and emphasized that justice must take into account the
particular situation of Timor-Leste and balance punitive and restorative elements.
The Prime Minister, in referring to the current climate of stability, indicated that
instability and violence do not arise simply from problems of formal justice but also
result from a lack of social justice. The national consensus dialogue, started in 2009,
was guided by a national steering committee composed of representatives of all

role in a responsible manner during this period. The Prime Minister also noted the
contribution of the opposition in his speech on the occasion of the third anniversary
of the formation of the AMP Government. The 21-22 August retreat showed that
national leaders are increasingly willing to come together to discuss national
priority issues. In this regard, President Ramos-Horta’s initiatives, as well as the
support of the Catholic Church, should be commended for their valuable
contribution to political dialogue and reconciliation. It is critical to maintain the

UNMIT_S/2009/504;57;2811;"57. Timor-Leste and UNMIT are currently at the beginning of a delicate process,
as the national police force begins to reassume primary policing responsibilities.
The steady and deliberate pace of the resumption of primary policing
responsibilities by the national police force reflects the serious consideration given
to the criteria developed jointly by UNMIT and the Timorese authorities. This
approach, which is not bound by a pre-determined, artificial timeline, is necessary
for the sustainable and long-term development of the institution as well as to avoid a
recurrence of the systematic failures that affected the police service in 2006.
Continued monitoring by UNMIT police in those districts and units that resume
responsibilities will be critical to ensuring the implementation of policies and
procedures., assessing institutional capabilities to deal with disciplinary and human
rights violations., and identifying further measures needed for strengthening the
development of the national police, as well as trends [PoliceReform, HumanRights: Monitor]. In conjunction with this
monitoring role, there is a need to maintain the capability of UNMIT police to
assume, in extremis, interim law enforcement, if requested and required. I commend
the Government’s efforts to date, in keeping with its responsibilities under the
certification process, to remove officers deemed unsuitable for police service. Its
continued efforts to remove such officers are critical to the credibility and integrity
of the national police.";;;;;;;Monitor;;;Monitor;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

institutions to function in an accountable and effective manner, with due respect for
the rule of law and human rights. The provisions contained in the package of draft
legislation currently being considered by Parliament which are aimed at upholding
human rights, the rule of law and civilian oversight are commendable. However,
defining a meaningful role for F-FDTL in a peacetime setting, clarifying its
relationship with the national police and establishing accountability mechanisms
and civilian oversight will be among the main challenges for the Government in
seeking consensus on and implementing such legislation. As my Deputy Special
Representative of the Secretary-General for Security Sector Support and Rule of
Law has shared with various Timorese interlocutors, the draft legislation’s proposed
S/2009/504
18 09-52536
mechanisms for parliamentary oversight could be strengthened, and provisions
dealing with crisis situations must clearly articulate the different roles and
responsibilities of F-FDTL and the national police, in conformity with the
Constitution of Timor-Leste [LegalReform: Assist, MilitaryReform, PoliceReform: AssistPolicies]. Given the importance of promoting awareness among
the general public on the key issues raised by the draft security legislation, it is
encouraging that the Parliamentary Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and

Special Representative will continue his good-offices efforts to promote
constructive political dialogue and facilitate unity of effort among all political actors
on important national issues [NationalReconciliation, PartyAssistance: Assist, Meeting]. Public statements by and the actions of various
political actors demonstrating respect for the rule of law and the institutions of
State, as well as the ability of the governing AMP coalition and the opposition to
jointly support some legislation in Parliament, have been encouraging. While the
exchange of differing opinions is an integral element of multiparty democracy, such
discourse should be constructively conducted and not exploited to heighten tensions
in society. I encourage the Government and Parliament to continue broad
consultation efforts, such as those undertaken regarding the draft laws on land and
local government.";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;Meeting,Assist;;;;Meeting,Assist;;;;;;;

F-FDTL recruitment began, and UNMIT is facilitating discussions between the
Secretary of State for Defence and bilateral partners for further development of
F-FDTL [MilitaryReform: AssistOther with IA]. The Ministry of Defence and Security is recruiting 12 civil servants for
procurement and asset management. On 7 July, Parliament approved amendments to
the law on liberation combatants, making more veterans eligible for pension
payments. Regarding the judiciary, the rule of law and human rights, a bimonthly
informal donor forum was established with the diplomatic community for policy
discussion on assistance to the justice sector, in particular with a view to addressing
gaps and overlaps. The new criminal code came into effect, and the courts made
efforts to improve the number of decisions taken in civil cases to avoid an increase
in the number of those pending. A review of the requirements for a casemanagement
system for the justice sector is under way in an effort to establish more
efficient caseload administration.";;;;;;;;;;;AssistOther,InternationalActor,Assist;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

investigations and enhancing the functioning of the judiciary, some progress was
achieved on serious crimes investigations and on the implementation of the
recommendations of the Special Commission of Inquiry (see para. 30 above). An
independent, comprehensive needs assessment of the justice sector is under way.
Once completed, the review and implementation of its recommendations, in liaison
with the Timorese authorities and in conjunction with the strategic plan for the
justice sector (see para. 36 above), will provide further momentum towards reaching
this benchmark. With respect to the third priority benchmark, on adherence to the
values and principles of sustainable democratic governance through respect for
Constitutional rights and guarantees for all citizens and to ethical standards, the
Government has sought at various levels to ensure strict ethical standards (see
para. 12 above) and to enhance respect for the rule of law (see paras. 36 and
37 above). The fourth priority benchmark refers to improved quality of life and
increased employment opportunities, especially focusing on rural areas and young
people and the sustainable return and reintegration of internally displaced persons.
The Government, with the support of UNMIT and the United Nations country team,
made concerted efforts to improve basic social services and livelihoods (e.g., in the
areas of education, health and nutrition, child protection), reduce poverty and create
additional employment opportunities (see paras. 38, and 41-44 above) [StateAdministration: Assist with IA]. A national

various laws and regulations have been promulgated, including on police promotion,
salaries and service structures (see para. 22 above). Other laws approved by the
Council of Ministers are under consideration by Parliament, such as the draft
national security, internal security and national defence laws. The resumption of

UNMIT_S/2009/504;36;2804;"36. The Government made significant progress towards the adoption of key
legislation and the development of a strategic plan for the justice sector. Parliament
approved a witness protection law on 17 February, and an instrument of ratification
of the United Nations Convention against Corruption was deposited by the
Government on 27 March. On 8 June, the new penal code entered into force,
incorporating core international criminal law and international human rights
standards and making domestic violence a public crime. A separate law specifically
addressing domestic violence was approved by the Council of Ministers on
19 August. The Ministry of Justice also conducted public consultations on a draft
land law. UNMIT contributed to those efforts through the provision of technical
assistance and recommendations on draft legislation [LegalReform: Assist, JusticeSectorReform: AssistOther]. The enactment of the penal
code notwithstanding, sexual assault and domestic violence cases, as well as many
other disputes, continued to be handled mainly through traditional mechanisms.
UNDP and UNMIT also assisted the Ministry in the undertaking of a consultative
process on access to justice, customary law and local justice in order to elaborate
guidelines for policy development and the formulation of draft legislation on
“traditional justice” [JusticeSectorReform: AssistPolicies with IA]. With UNMIT support, four consultants were selected to
conduct the independent comprehensive needs assessment of the justice sector

31 August, the team had completed investigations into 89 of 396 outstanding cases.,
an additional 21 cases are currently under investigation. Serious challenges affected
the pace of investigations, including difficulties in gaining access to remote areas
due to road and weather conditions., the considerable travel time required as a result
of the large areas of responsibility assigned to each investigation team., and
requirements for additional translators and interpreters. UNMIT therefore assigned
five additional interpreter positions, and will assign six UNMIT police investigators,
to serious crimes investigations in October 2009, after village elections. In his
speech on 30 August marking the tenth anniversary of the popular consultation, the
President called on the United Nations to disband the “Serious Crimes Unit” and to
direct the funds towards the strengthening of the Timorese judiciary. The efforts of
the Serious Crimes Investigation Team, however, involve a resumption of only the
investigative functions of the former Serious Crimes Unit. Subsequently, my Special
Representative underlined to the President the importance of the investigations

strengthening of PNTL, so that it effectively contributes to the building of a
professional and impartial national police service in Timor-Leste, remains one of its
greatest challenges [PoliceReform: AssistAgents, AssistOther]. The Government has urged that the resumption of full
responsibility for policing by PNTL should be completed in all districts and units by
the end of 2010. UNMIT will make all efforts for this to be achieved, subject to the
Government taking all possible action to meet the mutually agreed criteria for
resumption as well as to complete the certification process. However, it must be
stressed that the availability of operational logistical requirements in many districts,
including where resumption has already taken place, is far from adequate. If the
criterion of the availability of logistical requirements is strictly applied, it would
inevitably prolong the resumption process. This underscores the particular need for
firm actions and commitments by the Government to ensure that logistical
requirements are satisfied in the shortest possible timeframe. In this context, it is
warranted that a cautious approach should be taken to the initial drawdown of

currently lack the required capacity [MilitaryReform, PoliceReform: Monitor with IA]. Provision of a small but visible armed
uniformed element at United Nations headquarters to support its security guards to
secure and buffer this facility prior to reinforcement is necessary. On-call
reinforcements to defend United Nations headquarters and the Dili airport, to
provide escorts between the two locations, to assist with staff extraction and to
provide similar functions in the districts in times of civil unrest or other crisis
situations, if deemed necessary, remain prudent. The international security forces
currently provide this support under the military technical arrangement signed by
the United Nations and the Government of Australia on 25 January 2007 (see
S/2007/50, para. 41). A revision of the arrangement, proposed by the Government of
Australia, is currently under consideration. Decisions resulting from the proposed
revision of the arrangement will determine if present arrangements are sustainable

(including Government officials) interviewed by the technical assessment mission
was the lack of sufficient qualified human resources capacity among national
authorities, civil society and the business community [CivilSocietyAssistance: Monitor with IA]. The main underlying cause of
this capacity gap is insufficient access to quality education [StateAdministration: Monitor]. Less than half of
children complete primary school, owing in part to the poor quality of education
many of them receive. The Ministry of Education estimates that up to 85 per cent of
primary school teachers are not qualified for their posts. A major challenge in this
regard relates to language: while the Government requires primary education to be
conducted in Portuguese and Tetum, the majority of teachers are not sufficiently
proficient in Portuguese, and the development and standardization of written Tetum
have been delayed and received insufficient support. This has a direct impact on the
quality of education children receive. More than half of the population is unable to

the mortality rate for children under 5 years of age has almost halved since 1990

provide critical household income to supplement farm income. Microcredit and

limited irrigation, poor market access, and natural resource mismanagement resulting
in deforestation. Non-agriculture livelihood opportunities are extremely limited.
Ninety per cent of all female employment is in agriculture, and women in rural areas
are particularly at risk owing to increased male labour migration to urban areas and
marginalization with respect to land ownership rights and participation in household

short-term infrastructure investment priorities (water, sanitation and roads) will be

allocated to support rural development and agricultural services, conditions to allow
farmers to participate in a market economy enabled by the projected road network

posts in the border districts of Bobonaro, Covalima and Oecussi and one post each
in Dili and Baucau [BorderControl: Monitor with IA]. Those posts maintain liaison with Indonesian and Timorese
border control forces, F-FDTL and international security forces. The Military

activities and celebrations., the possibility that the security situation could escalate
in a very short time from an isolated incident., underlying security risks stemming
from unresolved grievances from the past., and poverty and unemployment, which
can give rise to heightened tensions and increasing criminal activity by martial arts
groups or others. The Public Order Battalion of PNTL does not yet have the
capacity, training, logistical support and equipment to assume crowd control
responsibilities throughout the country [PoliceReform: Monitor with IA]. There is, therefore, a need to maintain a
robust presence of UNMIT formed police units, even after the full reconstitution of
PNTL, to ensure a nationwide crowd control response capability. UNMIT police
will also provide static security support., pre-emptive police visibility at special and
major events, activities and demonstrations., and mentoring and training of the
PNTL Public Order Battalion. Two formed police unit platoons (of 35 officers each)

certification programme for PNTL, with 2,896 (578 women) officers, or 92 per cent

the removal of uncertified officers from PNTL. The remaining uncertified officers
face pending criminal and disciplinary proceedings. The Government has so far
taken measures against six non-certified officers who were convicted of crimes and
a seventh officer for not registering. However, the Government still needs to adopt
and issue relevant legislation to ensure the effective implementation of the
certification programme, with the assistance of UNMIT or other stakeholders, if
needed. Taking account of those factors, UNMIT is currently discussing possible
solutions with the Government to ensure that uncertified officers are suspended or

monitor the progress of PNTL in districts and units where they have resumed
policing responsibilities in order to sustain the continual reform and transfer of

commenced in May 2009 in Lautem district, and the Oecussi and Manatuto districts,
the Police Training Centre, Viqueque district, the Maritime Unit and the National

been taken that the Baucau and Ainaro districts will be handed over in early 2010.
UNMIT will make all efforts to ensure that the resumption process is completed by

UNMIT_S/2010/85;52;2727;"52. There is currently very little institutional capacity in PNTL for strategic public
communications [PoliceReform: Monitor with IA]. Dedicated staff and a budget are required, as well as a sustained
programme of capacity development, if PNTL is to be able to conduct national

especially with regard to community contacts at the district command level [PoliceReform: Monitor with IA]. Very
few community representatives have the opportunity to meet any police officers
above the level of community policing officers and the subdistrict commanders.
PNTL district commanders appear to be inaccessible to the community, and, as yet,
not to have taken initiatives to use the media to interact with the local community.
Even more seriously, community representatives, including the village (suco) chiefs,
are not aware of any channel in PNTL to address complaints against police officers
who misuse their authority or violate human rights. There is, in fact, no clear
mechanism for receiving and processing public complaints against police officers.";;;;;;;;;;Monitor,InternationalActor;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
UNMIT_S/2010/85;50;2725;"50. The lack of understanding of new laws is another serious challenge faced by
PNTL, frequently leading to its officers “mediating” between perpetrator and victim
on criminal offences [PoliceReform: Monitor with IA]. Some legislation is yet to be translated into Tetum, the
language of use for the majority of PNTL officers [LegalReform: Monitor with IA]. Investigation files sometimes are
written in four languages (Portuguese, Tetum, Indonesian and English), and thus

in the population’s confidence in the institution. However, allegations of corruption
and impunity for acts of misconduct, including some incidents involving arbitrary
arrests, excessive use of force and mishandling, in particular by the PNTL Task
Force, have damaged trust in PNTL, especially among youth and vulnerable groups [PoliceReform: Monitor with IA].
In most cases received by the UNMIT Human Rights and Transitional Justice
Section, community members choose not to file complaints, sometimes citing fear
of retaliation or pressure by PNTL members to resolve the case through informal
and traditional justice mechanisms. This underlines the need to strengthen
institutional policies and procedures regarding the use of force, in line with national
and international standards, and the constant need for human rights training [HumanRights: Monitor with IA]. A
training plan has been developed by UNMIT [HumanRights: Assist]. A suitable administrative disciplinary
mechanism, aligned with Timor-Leste’s current civil service rules and established
civilian oversight policies, needs to be established to ensure the accountability of

In almost every district and unit, PNTL continues to face serious challenges,
especially in the areas of transportation, logistics, communications, office
equipment and facilities, requiring them to depend on UNMIT police to carry out
their daily duties. Although several national operating norms and procedures have
been developed, the service still lacks standard operating procedures, directives,
guidelines and basic training exercises for the proper execution of their duties. Lack
of proper policy procedures for use of force, of facilities to store weapons and of
adequate accountability mechanisms have also contributed to the misuse of firearms
by PNTL officers, including on some occasions by officers carrying weapons while
not on duty, in contravention of the provisions of the PNTL organic law and
policies. The posts of the PNTL Border Police Unit lack resources, office facilities

sufficient for the needs of the country. With a total of 581 female officers in the

have improved slightly but it will take many years for them to be fully addressed.
Also challenging the young country will be the pressures brought on by population
growth, as Timor-Leste has one of the highest birth rates in the world. Persistent
inequalities in the distribution of wealth may create new fault lines or accentuate old
ones. Sudden economic shocks or unsound fiscal management could affect the
general security situation [EconomicDevelopment: Monitor with IA]. These issues have been somewhat mitigated by the
Government’s strategies, which include relying on oil money for expanded public
employment, cash transfer payments to vulnerable segments of the population,
salary increases and Government contracts for infrastructure and other projects [Resources: Monitor with IA].
While such strategies have contributed to stability in the short term, Government
spending alone will not guarantee increased prosperity and security in the long run.

the security forces themselves. Not atypical among post-liberation and post-conflict

of the President and the Prime Minister, progress has been made in reforms at the
sector-wide level and also in the development of both F-FDTL and PNTL, as well as

contributed to the 2006 crisis. These include civilian oversight and management,
and the definition and delineation of roles and responsibilities between F-FDTL and
PNTL. The Government is taking measures aimed at addressing those challenges,
including the development of a national security policy and draft security sector
legislation [LegalReform: Monitor with IA]. Challenges also persist in terms of institutional capacity, including
internal accountability mechanisms, professionalism and respect for human rights

the risk of confrontation between PNTL and F-FDTL is seen by most interlocutors

Timor-Leste by adopting the legislative framework and strengthening the justice
institutions [JusticeSectorReform, LegalReform: Monitor with IA]. Nevertheless, the formal justice system is characterized by a lack of
public confidence underpinned by perceived impunity. Furthermore, the principle of
separation of powers has not always been respected., as a notable example, former
militia leader Maternus Bere, arrested under an indictment for crimes against
humanity, was handed over to Indonesian officials by executive decision outside
judicial procedure. More recent Presidential pardons and commutations of sentences
involving a number of cases from 2006 and others have further contributed to

institutions and carried out peaceful elections in 2007 [DemocraticInstitutions, ElectoralSecurity: Monitor with IA], leading to a new Government
with a majority in Parliament and an active opposition, as well as village (suco)
elections in 2009. However, the strength of the democratic institutions has yet to be
fully tested., upcoming municipal and national elections in the 2010-2012 period
will be important indicators of the level of the progress made by Timor-Leste in its
transition to a democratic State based on the rule of law. Those elections will also
represent a crucial test of the country’s political stability and the capacity of PNTL.
Some political leaders have expressed apprehension about security during both
elections, which will be hotly contested. The preliminary phase of the municipal
elections is tentatively scheduled for 2010, but could be delayed, as prerequisite
legislation on decentralization has not yet been adopted by Parliament and political
consensus on administrative boundaries and other related issues has not yet been
achieved.

As good offices efforts are not just a matter of engagement at the highest levels, my
Special Representative has held regular meetings with representatives of all political

society, as well as from political party and Government officials, for UNMIT to
enhance its use of good offices to address impunity.

responsible for human rights violations were only rarely brought to justice.
Throughout the country, UNMIT received allegations of 22 cases of violations by
PNTL and of three cases of violations by F-FDTL during the reporting period. One
incident of concern occurred on 28 December 2009, when a member of PNTL in the

Dili district who was responding to a situation of disorder allegedly fired at least
one shot, resulting in the death of one youth and injury to another. The PNTL officer
suspected of firing was disarmed and placed on preventive suspension, and
appropriate disciplinary and criminal investigations commenced. In addition, the
Government established a civilian oversight team to oversee the PNTL investigation
into the incident, comprised of representatives of the Office of the Provedor for
Human Rights and Justice, the HAK Association (a human rights organization), the
Commission for Peace and Justice of Dili Diocese, and the Secretariat of State for
Security, with UNMIT as an observer [PoliceReform: Monitor]. As a further response to this incident, UNMIT
police reinforced patrolling, training, mentoring and monitoring activities for PNTL
in Dili district [Operations_PatrolsInterventions: Assist, PoliceReform: AssistAgents, Monitor]. The national media have led an intense public debate on policing in
Dili district since the incident. Amid those developments, there has also been

Representative on 13 May 2009 (see S/2009/504, para. 20), which reiterates the
mutually agreed criteria for the resumption of primary policing responsibilities by
PNTL, joint assessment teams of civilian and police representatives from the
Government and UNMIT assessed all 13 districts and three units as of 20 January [PoliceReform: Monitor].
In total, 19 assessments were conducted, including of some districts which were
assessed more than once. As of 20 January, PNTL had resumed primary policing
responsibilities in four districts (Lautem, Manatuto, Oecussi and Viqueque) and
three units (Police Training Centre, Maritime Unit and Intelligence Service). In
addition, the Prime Minister and my Special Representative have agreed that the
resumption by PNTL of primary policing responsibilities in two additional districts,
Ainaro and Baucau, would be scheduled for March [PoliceReform: AssistPolicies]. For those districts and units
where PNTL were assessed as not yet ready for resumption, UNMIT police and
PNTL have jointly developed and are implementing measures to enhance the latter’s
institutional capacities in order to facilitate such eventual resumption [PoliceReform: AssistPolicies]. In districts
and units where PNTL has resumed primary policing responsibilities, UNMIT police
continued to play a crucial role in monitoring and tracking progress in the
development of the institution while remaining available to provide advice and
operational support (and, in extremis, to reassume interim law enforcement, if
required and requested) [PoliceReform: Monitor, AssistOther]. UNMIT police monitoring activities revealed that, while

strengthen the performance of the national police, in particular in terms of its chain
of command, and improve the efficiency of special units by combining them into

Manatuto District on 25 July and the Police Training Centre on 11 September. Prior
to the start of this phase of police reconstitution, on 13 May Prime Minister Gusmão

of letters, which set forth the specific roles and responsibilities of the UNMIT police
and the national police after the latter resumes primary policing responsibilities in a
district or unit (see S/2009/72, para. 22) [PoliceReform: AssistPolicies]. The agreement reiterates the mutually
agreed criteria for resumption: (a) the ability of the national police to respond
appropriately to the security environment in a given district., (b) the final
certification of at least 80 per cent of eligible officers in a given district or unit to
resume primary policing responsibility., (c) the availability of initial operational
logistical requirements., and (d) institutional stability, which includes, inter alia, the
ability to exercise command and control, and community acceptance. The agreement
also provides for the establishment of a joint technical team consisting of civilian

71 national police officers (12 women) were still unregistered., 63 (11 women) of
them were still on the payroll list. The Government began to take measures against
those officers not certified as a result of pending criminal investigations or alleged
human rights abuses, including the dismissal of one officer who had also failed to

that the gradual resumption of policing responsibilities should not be bound by an
artificial calendar that may not accurately reflect the readiness of the national police
in any given district or unit. Instead, emphasis must be placed on the achievement of
criteria in order to guarantee the integrity of the resumption process and ensure that
any future crisis or pressure does not result in the police service facing further
systemic failures. Based on this view, the Government and UNMIT are now
discussing the possibility of starting the process of the resumption of policing
responsibilities on 27 March 2009 [PoliceReform: Meeting]. In the meantime, a continuing robust UNMIT
police presence across the country, including formed police units, is necessary, both
to support the resumption of responsibilities and to continue to help guarantee
public security while that process is under way. To that end, I urge the Government
to continue working with UNMIT to further develop the framework for resumption
of policing responsibility and to ensure that steps are taken to meet sustainable
logistical requirements for the national police. The resumption will be only one step
in the long-term development process of the national police, and will depend on the
continuing commitment of the Government and the international community,
including bilateral partners.";;;;;;;;;;Meeting;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

2008, activities included daily mentoring of the Provedor’s Monitoring and
Advocacy Department, workshops on workplan revision and monitoring, and two
workshops for civil society partners. The Provedor, UNMIT and civil society
partners conducted joint monitoring of key issues, particularly returns of internally
displaced persons and alleged human rights violations by the national police [HumanRights, RefugeeAssistance, PoliceReform: Monitor, CivilSocietyAssistance: Assist]. From

reportedly faced minor disciplinary measures and a few cases remained under
investigation, no member of the security forces had been brought to justice for

initial recommendations of the expert mission on policing, and support provided by
the Standing Police Capacity of the Department of Peacekeeping Operations during

initial operational logistical requirements., and (d) institutional stability, which
includes, inter alia, the ability to exercise command and control, and community
acceptance. The readiness of the individual districts and units will be determined by

not experienced significant progress in poverty alleviation or in the achievement of
the Millennium Development Goals since the restoration of its independence in
2002. Per capita income in the non-oil economy is about 20 per cent lower than it
was in 2002, implying that poverty is increasing. Public investments need to
increase in the non-oil-and-gas sectors if the economy is to experience real growth
over the next several years. Some of this investment could well come from the
Petroleum Fund. Taking the low level of budget execution into consideration and
without changing the fundamental operation or sustainability of the Fund, ways of
“front-loading” expenditures from the Petroleum Fund to help promote sustainable
economic growth and alleviate poverty need to be considered. UNMIT and its
United Nations partners have been advocating a prudent, sustainable approach to the
management of Timor-Leste’s petroleum wealth, within the framework of a

judges, prosecutors and public defenders. The probationary actors are receiving
on-the-job training and mentoring from international and national mentors for a
one-year period, after which they will be evaluated and sworn in. These jurists are
students from the second training course at the Legal Training Centre who
completed their classroom training in December 2007 (see S/2008/26, para. 37). The
third postgraduate course at the Legal Training Centre started in July. UNMIT
reviewed existing training curricula and materials for judges, public defenders,
prosecutors and police officers and continues its efforts to advocate for inclusion of
additional sessions on child rights and juvenile justice at the Legal Training Centre
and police training institutions [JusticeSectorReform: Monitor, Advocate, ChildRights, PoliceReform: Advocate]. In spite of an increase in human resources, the
backlog of cases continued to grow., it is currently estimated at 4,700 criminal cases,
of which approximately one third involve gender-based crimes. The United Nations

on complaints management., briefings on relevant human rights issues, including on
persons with disabilities., the establishment of national inquiries and human rights
education., and advice to the Provedor in relation to the state of siege. UNIFEM
provided training to the Provedor on the Convention on the Elimination of All
Forms of Discrimination against Women, with specific focus on gender-based
violence. During the state of siege, the Provedor conducted joint monitoring visits to
areas of Joint Command operations, with representatives of UNMIT and the local
non-governmental organization, the HAK Foundation, to document violations,
resulting in the tabling of three reports to Parliament by the Provedor [HumanRights: Monitor with IA]. By 1 July, the

presented challenges to the respect for human rights. On the positive side, the
Government adhered to constitutional provisions when declaring the state of siege.
Restrictions defined in relevant legislation on the right to movement, and on
freedom to demonstrate and assemble, and provisions for members of the military to
conduct home searches at night with judicial warrants did not violate Timor-Leste’s
international obligations. Serious concerns arose, however, concerning an increase
in allegations of ill-treatment, excessive use of force and intimidation, in particular
during arrest, by members of the Joint Command. UNMIT also received reports of
death threats, illegal arrests, illegal home searches and abuse of authority. UNMIT
regularly provided information on cases of alleged human rights violations or abuse
of power to the appropriate Timorese authorities up to the highest levels [HumanRights: Assist].
Accountability mechanisms were extremely weak, however., even when identified,
perpetrators often faced only a verbal reprimand, including in cases of serious
beatings.";;;;;;;Assist;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

successfully completed its development, nor that it is prepared to take on those
responsibilities without continuing international assistance. Rather, it is another,
more intensive phase of its professional development, where officers will learn by
doing, while the United Nations is still available in strength to provide them with
support and backup. It will lay the groundwork for the long-term process of
developing an impartial and professional police service. It is, therefore, not
proposed that the UNMIT police draw down their presence during the resumption of
responsibilities by the national police. Rather, the UNMIT police will continue to
play a crucial role of monitoring and reporting from all districts, while also being
available to provide advice, as well as offer operational support and, in extremis,
assume interim law enforcement responsibilities, if required and requested [PoliceReform: Monitor, AssistAgents]. The
continued presence of the four formed police units will provide necessary support to
UNMIT and the national police in the maintenance of stability.";;;;;;;;;;Monitor,Assist,AssistAgents;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

(see S/2008/26, para. 22). Some national police officers continued to resist
supervision by UNMIT police [PoliceReform: AssistAgents]., the participation of large numbers of national police
officers in the Joint Command removed from UNMIT police supervision
exacerbated this trend. The resumption of responsibility by the national police will
be facilitated through a revised and streamlined mentoring programme, with
mandatory training focusing on core competencies, developed and implemented
jointly by UNMIT police and national police officers. This should allow final
certification of 80 per cent of the national police by 1 October 2008. Before full
reconstitution is completed, all officers with major disciplinary and/or criminal
issues should be removed from the force and only certified officers should serve.";;;;;;;;;;Assist,AssistAgents;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

expert mission led by the United Nations Police Adviser visited the country and
issued a report that made comprehensive recommendations (see S/2008/329) on
policing and broader rule of law and security sector reform issues. Subsequently, at
S/2008/501
08-43224 7
the request of my Special Representative, members of the Standing Police Capacity
of the Department of Peacekeeping Operations, with support from the International
Center for Transitional Justice, were deployed to UNMIT for eight weeks starting on
23 May to assist with the implementation of the expert mission’s recommendations.
With this support, strategies were developed in close consultation with the Secretary
of State for Security and the national police to establish a timetable for the national
police’s resumption of policing responsibilities. This would be based on the three
phases of reconstitution described in the Policing Arrangement, recognizing that the
initial phase has been completed. During the second, consolidation phase, initial
planning envisages that there will be a gradual resumption of policing
responsibilities by the national police in specified districts and units starting in
August 2008, to be completed in the first half of 2009. The calendar for the
resumption of responsibility was developed by UNMIT in close consultation with
the leadership of the national police and the Timorese Government [PoliceReform: AssistPolicies]. It will be
adjusted by carefully assessing the state of readiness of the national police using
five criteria: (a) the security environment., (b) staffing levels of certified officers.,
(c) the availability of initial operational logistical requirements., (d) institutional
stability., and (e) mutual respect between F-FDTL and the national police.";;;;;;;;;;Assist,AssistPolicies;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Most of the incidents reported were assaults and disorderly behaviour, and were
promptly attended to by the police. During the reporting period, an average of 34
incidents was reported per week, far lower than the average of 54 during the last
reporting period. The incidence of serious crimes such as murder, abduction and
rape also decreased, from about five per month during the previous reporting period
to about four in the current period. This positive trend is due in large part to the
UNMIT and national police approach of targeted patrolling of problem areas,
special attention being given to areas identified as particularly volatile, as well as to
the restrictions on movements imposed by the curfews [Operations_PatrolsInterventions: Assist]. The presence and activities
of UNMIT military liaison officers in the border districts provided a stabilizing
effect and contributed to maintaining good relations between the border agencies of
Timor-Leste and Indonesia [BorderConrol: Assist]. Military liaison officers also played an efficient
information-gathering role on issues affecting security throughout all the other

reformulate the office of the Inspector General to perform audit functions, and
establish an anti-corruption agency [DemocraticInstitutiosn: Assist]. UNDP efforts have continued in support of
capacity-building related to procedural and legislative processes within the

confidence among the Timorese population in their security institutions, one of
the most critical institutions warranting sustained assistance is the national
police service. Despite considerable progress in the screening and mentoring
process, the national police force requires further training, institutional
development and strengthened capacities to be in a position to assume full
responsibility for dealing with potentially volatile security situations. UNMIT
police officers, particularly those in formed police units, have continued to be
required to respond to group fighting and public disturbances, and have in
large part contributed to the relatively stable security situation and the drop in
serious criminal offences, with the support of the international security forces [Operations_PatrolsInterventions: Implement with IA].

human rights protection and the promotion of justice. UNMIT, in collaboration with
OHCHR, assisted the Provedoria for Human Rights and Justice in establishing an
advisory council comprised of representatives of diverse groups, including religious
communities, women, handicapped persons and businesses [HumanRights, Gender, CivilSocietyAssistance: Assist with IA]. This facilitated the
admission of the Office of the Provedoria to the Asia-Pacific Forum for National
Human Rights Institutions in September 2007. The Office of the Provedoria
organized a human rights monitoring mission to Viqueque subdistricts, and also
presented a monitoring analysis with recommendations for improving conditions in
police detention centres in Dili. UNMIT provided technical assistance to
non-governmental organizations to improve their ability to make effective use of a
database of alleged human rights violations established and managed by a
non-governmental organization in 2005 [HumanRights, CivilSocietyAssistance: Implement]. In December 2007, a manual (in the Tetum

attitudes towards sexual and gender-based violence, which will serve as the basis for
identifying appropriate community-level support required by women to prevent such

Covalima and Oecussi. This deployment, supported by UNDP, contributes to better
access by the population to the justice system. Moreover, the 2008 budget includes a
significant increase in the allocation for the justice sector. The Minister of Justice

Timor-Leste covering the period from August 2006 to August 2007 [HumanRights: Monitor]. The report
noted that the citizens of Timor-Leste enjoyed a range of fundamental human rights,
including freedom of speech, freedom of assembly and freedom of religion. The
report also highlighted that, since August 2006, important progress in the promotion
and protection of human rights had been achieved in a number of areas, including
the holding of peaceful elections [ElectoralSecurity, ElectionAssistance: Monitor] widely regarded as free and fair, strengthening of
capacities in the judicial system [JusticeSectorReform: Monitor], initiation of judicial processes relating to crimes
committed during the 2006 crisis, and expanded monitoring and investigative
activities of the Provedoria for Human Rights and Justice. However, the report also
emphasized that considerable challenges remained to be addressed to ensure the
safeguarding of human rights, including, inter alia, ensuring adequate standards of
living (e.g., housing, basic services and employment), combating domestic and
gender-based violence [SexualViolence: Monitor], and creating conditions for the voluntary and peaceful return
of internally displaced persons [RefugeeAssistance: Monitor]. The need for increased access to justice and
protection of the population in the districts, and for strengthened accountability for
cases of misconduct among the security forces [MilitaryReform, PoliceReform: Monitor], was also highlighted. The report also

assisting the UNMIT police and the national police in the maintenance of law and
order in the eastern districts during and after the August 2007 unrest, and by
maintaining static security at some key installations in Dili. Nevertheless, in some
instances, Timorese soldiers assuming static security tasks fired warning shots in
violation of the rules of engagement, and occasional disputes emerged between
individual military and police members. The armed forces command was responsive
when UNMIT raised concerns regarding these incidents. However, their occurrence
highlights the need to further improve relations between the security forces as well
as to strengthen institutional policies and procedures appropriate for a military force
in a peacetime setting, as part of a holistic approach to security sector reform. In
order to help address some of these concerns, in December UNMIT initiated
training for armed forces personnel on national and international human rights
standards, principles regarding the use of force, and command responsibility to
ensure respect for human rights standards [MilitaryReform: AssistAgents, HumanRights: Assist]. The joint national police/armed forces
parades and collaboration on activities to celebrate independence day on

police officers, UNMIT has started to discuss with the Government the process of
the phased transfer of law enforcement responsibility to the national police,
although there are particular concerns regarding its still weak logistical capabilities
(including lack of sufficient facilities, vehicles and communication equipment) [PoliceReform: Meeting]. In
accordance with the policing arrangement, and the reform, restructuring and
rebuilding plan being negotiated with the Government, the schedule for handover
depends on the status of (a) the certification programme., (b) the achievement of
benchmarks and performance targets set out in the reform, restructuring and
rebuilding plan., and (c) the security situation. Taking account of these factors, a
phased handover of districts and/or special police units is projected to begin in April
2008, with the Rapid Intervention Unit likely to be the first unit to be declared fully
operational. Thereafter, depending on progress, it is envisaged that handover could
proceed at the rate of one district every two months, starting with Dili district. The
schedule will also take account of the outcome of a “pilot handover” of three police
substations in Dili to commence in January 2008. However, some UNMIT police
officers will be required to remain in handed-over districts in order to provide
continuing advice and support to the national police officers and to liaise with and

mentoring process for the national police [PoliceReform: AssistAgents]. Some police officers, especially in the
districts, have resisted supervision and mentoring by UNMIT police as they consider
themselves ready to assume increased operational responsibilities, although the
majority of officers have been cooperative and are willing to undergo all
requirements of the certification process. Further, a number of Timorese leaders,
including the Prime Minister, the Secretary of State for Security and the General
Commander Designate of the national police, have publicly raised concerns
regarding the pace of the certification process and have appealed for increased
operational tasks to be given to national police officers as well as accelerated
handover of policing responsibilities in the districts. In addition, some concerns
have been raised regarding the inadequate number of UNMIT police with

S/2007/513, para. 25) [PoliceReform: AssistOther]. On 1 December 2007, the registration of all officers was
completed, except for 88 who failed to register and are no longer considered part of
the police service. All 3,108 registered officers (570 women) had completed the
screening process as at 7 January 2008. Of the 3,108 screened officers, 186
(42 women) successfully completed both the provisional certification course and the
six-month mentoring process and became fully certified officers. Another 1,503
(271 women) are provisionally certified (having passed the provisional certification
course) and are in the mentoring stage. On the other hand, 296 (22 women) require
further investigation due to allegations of criminal acts or human rights violations
which will be adjudicated by the Timorese-led police evaluation panel. The
remaining 1,123 screened officers are either undertaking, or waiting to take, the
provisional certification course. As adequate training facilities were not available in
some locations, UNMIT established mobile teams to provide the provisional
certification course [PoliceReform: AssistAgents]., instruction has been completed in Ermera and Manatuto

improved, with no major security incidents or spikes in violence occurring. The
incidence of serious crimes such as murder, abduction and rape also decreased, from
about nine per month during the previous reporting period to about five in the
current period. This positive trend is due in large part to the strategic approaches
adopted by the UNMIT police and the national police of improved information
gathering, targeted patrolling of problem areas and community policing to prevent
crimes, with special attention given to areas identified as particularly volatile [Operation_PatrolsInterventions: Assist]. For
example, from 21 to 24 November, following information received locally, the
UNMIT police, working alongside national police officers and assisted by the
international security forces, successfully conducted a weapons recovery operation
in Dili’s troublesome Bairo Pite area [ControlSALW: Assist with IA]. Recovered weapons included bows and

the police. The recent swearing-in of 27 judges, prosecutors and defenders is a
positive step towards increasing the justice system’s capacity. UNMIT, together

issues of particular concern. An Administration of Justice Support Section,
consisting of gender, juvenile and corrections officers, was established within
UNMIT [SexualViolence, ChildRights, PrisonReform: Implement]. It will initially focus, in cooperation with the Timorese authorities, on an
independent review of the justice sector. The United Nations Children’s Fund

to support the Office of the Prime Minister for the Promotion of Equality by assisting with the drafting of legislation and policies, engaging in capacity-building
and conducting advocacy on issues of concern to women and children, including
domestic violence and child protection. Together with the Vulnerable Persons Unit
of the national police force, they also helped the Ministry of Labour and Community
Reinsertion and the Ministry of Health to strengthen services for victims of abuse

30 August 2006 (see S/2007/50, para. 10) and 17 February 2007, despite
recommendations for follow-up measures by inquiry commissions initiated by the
Ministry of Justice. There is still no strategic plan for the corrections system,
procedures are largely ad hoc, and executive and management structures are weak or
non-existent. The UNDP justice programme recently established a corrections
component that developed a workplan, submitted to the Government, to address

national human rights institution [HumanRights: AssistOther]. UNDP and OHCHR commenced a joint capacitybuilding
project with the Provedor’s Office earlier this year, which has so far
provided training for staff of the Office and non-governmental organization partners
on human rights principles, human rights and election monitoring and civic
education. This complements earlier efforts by the Office of the United Nations
High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) to strengthen the Provedor’s Office in
monitoring the human rights situation of internally displaced persons. As of
mid-June, the Provedor’s Office had received 66 cases of alleged human rights
violations, of which 16 were closed for statutory reasons (including lack of
jurisdiction) and 23 submitted with recommendations to the competent authorities.
In addition, the Office submitted 12 cases of alleged abuse of authority to the
national police in July.

could face a serious setback if the Law on Truth and Measures of Clemency for
Diverse Offences adopted by the Parliament on 4 June was promulgated by the
President. A ruling by the Court of Appeals on the 4 July request by President
Ramos-Horta to review the law’s constitutionality was pending as of mid-August. A
number of ongoing police and prosecutorial investigations into a range of crimes
committed between 20 April 2006 and 30 April 2007 would have to cease if the Law
were promulgated. UNMIT, on several occasions, reiterated to the Timorese

Section, continued to monitor and report on the human rights situation and focused
on further strengthening the capacity of non-governmental organizations and the
Office of the Provedor for Human Rights and Justice [HumanRights, CivilSocietyAssistance: Monitor]. To this end, a database of
alleged human rights violations established in 2005 was upgraded in June 2007, and

relations between the security forces, strengthen the legal framework, increase
operational capabilities and enhance civilian oversight, will be addressed in the
context of the security sector reform process. The Security Sector Review Joint
Working Group, co-chaired by senior representatives of the Ministry of Defence, the
Ministry of the Interior and UNMIT (see S/2007/50, para. 38), continued to meet
during the reporting period [PoliceReform, MilitaryReform: Meeting], and three workshops were held to review various sector
components. The first seminar, on 18 July, was dedicated to the draft police reform
plan (see para. 26 above) [PoliceReform: AssistPolicies]. Input from that seminar will be used by UNMIT police
and the national police to finalize the plan. The second seminar, on 26 July,
examined plans for the further development of the police and military, and identified
several areas for interoperability [PoliceReform, MilitaryReform: AssistPolicies]. The third seminar, on 16 August, involving the
President, the Prime Minister and other new ministers as well as senior military and
police officers, discussed means by which the security sector review process could
be taken forward. The Timorese leaders expressed their strong commitment to
conduct the comprehensive review and welcomed the support of UNMIT.";;;;;;;;;;Meeting,Assist,AssistPolicies;Meeting,Assist,AssistPolicies;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

partnership with the Ministry of the Interior and with the support of the UNMIT
Human Rights and Transitional Justice Section, the Office of the Provedor for
Human Rights and Justice and civil society organizations, proceeded with the
registration and certification programme for the Timorese national police [PoliceReform: AssistOther]. Priority
was given to the police force in Dili, which virtually disintegrated during the 2006
crisis. As of 20 August, 1,247 of the estimated 1,258 Dili-based police officers
(including 189 women) had registered for screening. Of these, 981 (168 women)
were provisionally certified and returned to active duty under the mentorship of
UNMIT police [PoliceReform: AssistAgents

criminal acts or human rights violations., 76 (no women) who completed integrity
inquiries were referred to the evaluation panel for a decision on suitability., and 44
(no women) were granted final certification after satisfactory completion of the sixmonth
mentoring programme. The remaining Dili-based officers are still in the
screening process. In the districts, 1,804 of 1,949 police officers registered, and
screening has commenced. On 22 April, UNMIT facilitated a human rights training
session for senior police commanders which focused on the need for strengthening
accountability within the service [PoliceReform: AssistAgents, HumanRights: Assist].

including political party campaigning, voting and counting [ElectoralSecurity: AssistOther with IA, PartyAssistance, ElectionAssistance: ProvideSecurity with IA]. As mentioned above,
my Special Representative’s repeated appeal to parties on the need for the peaceful
conduct of political activities and moderation of political rhetoric also helped
resolve political disagreements before they could spill onto the streets [ElectoralSecurity, PartyAssistance: Advocate]. The political
parties also deserve credit for working to uphold the code of conduct and the
political party accord. Still, there were instances of assault and rock throwing
directly related to the elections. During the last days of campaigning for both the
first round of the presidential election and the parliamentary election, there were a
number of fights and instances of rock throwing in Dili, partly because a number of
campaign events were held simultaneously in close proximity, often involving
convoys of trucks travelling to and from campaign events. A spate of arson attacks
in Ermera district between April and June, not all related to elections, resulted in the
destruction of about 100 houses. On 3 June, there were two shooting incidents
resulting in two deaths in Viqueque district. One of these involved a national police
officer at a campaign rally who was promptly arrested and later sentenced to six
years’ imprisonment by the Baucau District Court on 17 August.";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;AssistOther,Advocate,Assist,InternationalActor;ProvideSecurity,InternationalActor;;ProvideSecurity,Advocate,InternationalActor;;;;;;;;;;;

international security forces in Manufahi district to apprehend Alfredo Reinado that
resulted in the death of five members of his armed group, although he eluded
capture. This provoked youth in several neighbourhoods in Dili and Ermera to set up
roadblocks with burning tyres and large boulders and to stone international vehicles
throughout the night. In dispersing gangs of youths, UNMIT police were forced to
resort at times to the use of rubber bullets and tear gas [Opeartions_PatrolsInterventions, Operations_UseofForce: Implement]. Reinado’s reappearance in
public in Manufahi district in mid-July set off similar incidents, although the scale
was much smaller owing in part to improved police response. Since mid-June, State
institutions have sought the fugitive’s submission to the formal justice process in a
peaceful manner to safeguard public security. In response to Reinado’s written
indication of his readiness to submit to justice, President Ramos-Horta decided on
19 June that all police and military operations aimed at capturing Reinado should
cease with a view to starting a dialogue to create the necessary conditions for him to
surrender to justice together with the weapons in his possession. A meeting between
the President and Reinado took place on 19 August.";;;;;;;;;;;;Implement;Implement;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

number of observations in its publicly available reports. In line with the Team’s
recommendations, UNMIT proposed a number of amendments to electoral
legislation, several of which were adopted by Parliament [LegalReform, ElectionAssistance: Assist]. In its final report, the
Team concluded that the majority of the benchmarks underpinning the certification
exercise were either fully or partially met. In areas where benchmarks were
considered unmet, the Team made a number of recommendations to improve the
conduct of future elections, including measures to guarantee the independence of the
electoral authorities and consolidation of the legal framework. These will be
pursued by UNMIT as part of its continuing support for the electoral process, the

ensure that the elections exercise was participatory, constructive, and non-violent [ElectionAssistance: Implement (*ElectionAssistance: ProvideSecurity and ElectoralSecurity: Implement may be coded taking a cue from ""non-violent"")].
The political party accord and the code of conduct of the National Electoral
Commission, as well as the discussion process leading to their adoption, played a
significant role in minimizing political disturbances during the electoral period.
UNMIT and United Nations agencies supported several initiatives to ensure an
inclusive approach to the elections [ElectionAssistance: Assist with IA]. The United Nations Development Fund for
Women (UNIFEM) and the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP)
tailored components of the voter education programme to address women voters.
With support from UNIFEM, a Timorese women’s organization monitored political
party programmes to assess commitments to women’s rights and gender equality,
and offered support to women in political parties, resulting in the signing of a
women’s political platform by 12 of the parties. One of the eight presidential
candidates was a woman, and one of the 16 parties competing in the parliamentary
election, which won three seats, was led by a woman. Eighteen of the 65 elected Parliament members are women. UNDP maintained close cooperation with civil
society organizations in promoting broad citizen participation. Dedicated political
party resource centres were established in Baucau, Maliana, Oecussi and Dili and
used by around 2,000 party members, who praised them as an important support
mechanism, and training was also provided. In addition, UNDP provided 2,250
national and 500 international observers with briefings and logistical assistance.";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;InternationalActor,Implement;;;;;;;;;;;;;
UNMIT_S/2007/513;12;2574;"12. UNMIT provided logistical support during various stages of the electoral
process, including support for the travel of electoral officials to Indonesia to oversee
various ballot production processes [ElectionAssitance: MaterialSupport]. UNMIT also assisted all political parties in
travelling to the isolated district of Oecussi for campaign activities [PartyAssistance: MaterialSupport]. The
Government conducted the distribution and recovery of electoral materials with
significant UNMIT support, including vehicles and helicopter airlift to inaccessible
areas [ElectionAssistance: MaterialSupport]. Additional support was provided by the international security forces deployed
to Timor-Leste by Australia and New Zealand. As a result, all 504 polling centres in
the presidential elections and 520 polling centres in the parliamentary election were
able to open on time, except for three remote locations cut off by heavy rain during
the parliamentary election, which opened a few hours late. As requested by the
Timorese authorities, UNMIT ensured the integrity of the electoral process by
having its police provide continuous accompaniment of the ballots from the time of delivery to Timor-Leste to the final counting and tabulation [ElectionAssistance: ProvideSecurity, ElectoralSecurity: Implement]. Party agents were also

accomplish its mandate of supervising the electoral process, barely six months after
its establishment in January 2007 with limited national capacity [ElectionAssistance: Assist]. The Commission
fielded four officials, supplemented by three United Nations Volunteers, in each of
the country’s districts to supervise the work of the Technical Secretariat. UNMIT

facilitated by my Special Representative [LocalReconciliation, PartyAssistance: Assist], demonstrates the strong will of the
political leaders and civil society to move beyond the divisions that affected the
country in 2006. However, with the persisting political divides confronting the new

registered political parties on 25 May, before the parliamentary election campaign
commenced, along with a code of conduct formulated by the National Electoral
Commission [ElectionAssistance, PartyAssistance: Assist]. The code of conduct mainly related to candidate and party behaviour
during the electoral campaign, while the complementary accord consisted of
commitments to condemn all forms of violence, adhere to principles of good governance and ensure a meaningful role for the opposition in Parliament after the
elections. During the course of the electoral process, the Mission’s regular meetings
with the political parties provided an important forum for discussing election-related
issues [PartyAssistance, ElectionAssistance: Meeting]. These meetings will continue, including with those parties that did not obtain
seats in Parliament but together received around 10 per cent of the votes. UNMIT
also facilitated district-level political accords and community dialogues in specific
districts where there had been security problems [ElectoralSecurity: Outreach]. In addition, numerous dialogue
initiatives emerged in communities that experienced security problems during the
electoral process, reflecting the desire of the Timorese people to settle conflicts
peacefully. UNMIT is supporting President Ramos-Horta’s initiative to establish a
structure of ongoing national community-led dialogue, and efforts are under way to

regularly to coordinate, as mandated, the activities of UNMIT and the Government,
and proved to be a valuable forum for collaboration and consensus-building.
Throughout the electoral period, the Committee members engaged in constructive
discussions on various aspects of the elections and reached consensus on ways to
improve the process, including on needed amendments to electoral legislation, the

approximately 600 police officers could be gradually phased out and the
capacity of formed police units downsized to one unit of 140 personnel. The
pace of this downsizing will need to be carefully considered by a post-election

persons, which led to a general consensus among the Ministries, United Nations
agencies and non-governmental organizations that efforts to assist internally
displaced persons to return to their homes in Dili or to relocate to other suitable
areas should be increased [RefugeeAssistance: Meeting with IA, CivilSocietyAssistance: Implement with IA]. As a result, an operational plan for durable solutions to
internal displacement was prepared to support the return and reintegration process.
However, as of January 2007, around 100,000 persons remain displaced, although
these numbers fluctuate. In June 2006, internally displaced persons were almost
evenly distributed between Dili and the districts, but since then there has been a
shift from Dili to the districts, with an estimated 29,000 persons remaining in camps
in Dili and the rest staying with host families in the districts and in internally
displaced persons’ camps in Baucau. The onset of the rainy season in December
aggravated the situation in the camps. The international community assisted the
Government in identifying and setting up alternative emergency shelter sites for
internally displaced persons staying in high-risk camps. As at 31 January 2007,

cooperation with the international security forces and the UNMIT police, some
military liaison officers may need to be relocated to Baucau. This would enable
these officers to monitor, along with the UNMIT police, the situation in the eastern

They urged that “normalization” proceed cautiously and in close coordination with
the international security forces in the country [MilitaryReform: Advocate]. The Government undertook to share
an action plan setting out the steps of the “normalization” of F-FDTL. The Mission
is awaiting receipt of the plan. Nevertheless, since that date, armed F-FDTL soldiers
have been increasingly present in public, including near the Dili District Court on
12 January during a preliminary hearing related to a number of F-FDTL soldiers. At
times, they have also provided static security for State facilities and public events.
The presence of armed F-FDTL soldiers has been perceived by some among the
population as intimidating and exacerbating the sense of insecurity.";;;;;;;;;;;Meeting,Advocate;;;;Meeting;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Dili was perceived as a potential obstacle to the conduct of elections without threat
of violence or intimidation, in particular violence using weapons that remain
unaccounted for since the crisis. UNMIT police and the international security forces
continue to undertake joint efforts to locate and recover these firearms [ControlSALW: Implement with IA, ElectoralSecurity: Implement with IA]. In
preparation for the elections, UNMIT police has drafted an operational plan to
ensure the necessary security coverage throughout the country from the election
campaign period through the immediate post-electoral period [ElectoralSecurity: AssistPolicies with IA]. The development and
implementation of the elections security plan is being closely coordinated with
UNMIT’s Electoral Assistance Office and the Timorese authorities, with the
operational support of the international security forces as needed. The UNMIT
police deployment to the 13 districts was closely coordinated with the movement of
electoral staff.

the Office of the Provedor and civil society organizations, UNMIT police
established a screening process for PNTL [PoliceReform: AssistOther]. As of 22 January 2007, 1,087 out of
1,232 Dili-based PNTL officers had registered for screening. Two-hundred and
seventy-six PNTL officers completed the Police Academy’s provisional certification
course and, as no allegations of criminal acts or human rights violations came to the
attention of UNMIT, they returned to active duty without firearms under the
mentorship of UNMIT police [PoliceReform: AssistAgents]. During the screening process, 342 PNTL officers
were identified as requiring further investigation. The remaining Dili-based PNTL
officers are still going through the screening process. About 2,000 PNTL officers
deployed in the districts will undergo the screening process in the coming months.
In response to a request from the Timorese Government, screening of PNTL
members of the Rapid Intervention Unit was given priority to ensure the co-location
of screened and re-trained officers from this Unit with UNMIT formed police units
before the elections. Other specialized PNTL units, including the Border Police
Unit, will also be subject to careful screening in the near future.

police units focused on restoring and maintaining law and order in Dili.
Subsequently, starting at the end of November, small numbers of UNMIT police
deployed to the 12 districts outside of Dili, where they worked together in colocation
with PNTL officers who remained operational throughout and following the
crisis [PoliceReform: AssistOther]. The nationwide presence of UNMIT police officers enhanced their
understanding of the security situation in the districts and helped to pre-empt some
tense situations from escalating into violence, as evidenced by the prevention of
large-scale fighting between rival martial arts groups in Maubisse in early January.
In order to encourage cooperation from the local communities and promote a better,
understanding of its initiatives and activities, UNMIT police, in collaboration with
the UNMIT Public Information Office, disseminated information on police
operations through press conferences as well as daily radio and regular television
broadcasts [PoliceReform: Outreach]. UNMIT police also provided personnel to serve in UNMIT’s Joint
Operations Centre and Joint Mission Analysis Cell.";;;;;;;;;;Monitor,Assist,AssistOther;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
UNMIT_S/2007/50;31;2555;"31. As had been the case from the onset of the crisis in early 2006, Dili has
remained the main centre of incidents of violence, and security is still fragile in
various neighbourhoods of the city. The earlier east/west-based violence in Dili,
which had resulted in a number of deaths, serious injuries and burning of houses, on
occasion involving persons in internally displaced persons’ camps and in the
surrounding areas, decreased over the reporting period. On the other hand, localized
violence increased between neighbourhood youth gangs and members of rival
martial arts groups, largely confined to Dili but with occasional incidents in other
districts. Rocks, machetes and iron darts continued to be the most commonly used
weapons in such gang-fights, in some cases causing deaths or serious injuries. Of
growing concern were a few incidents in which firearms and hand-grenades were
used. Nevertheless, the overall level of violence has decreased in recent months, in
part due to the increase in dialogue initiatives in Dili as well as intensified
community-policing efforts of UNMIT, the establishment of additional police posts
in troubled areas and the installation of a toll-free national emergency line, all of
which facilitated increased police responsiveness. In addition, Prime Minister
Ramos-Horta and other local leaders as well as UNMIT police, made increased
efforts to bring together martial arts groups to peacefully settle their differences, to
discourage violence and to work towards improvement in the security situation [LocaclReconciliation: Assist].";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;Assist;;;;;;
UNMIT_S/2007/50;30;2554;"30. While the overall security situation has remained volatile, the trend has been
towards increasingly longer periods of calm and fewer outbreaks of violence, due, in
part, to the increased presence and numbers of UNMIT police officers in
communities throughout all districts of the country, including internally displaced
persons’ camps, where they work with approximately 250 screened PNTL officers
and rely on the close support of the international security forces, as needed. Civil
disturbance incidents in Dili have decreased from an average of 20 to 30 daily in
September and October, to 10 to 15 from November through January. Those
averages need to be seen, however, in the light of spikes in violence that have
occurred and which could continue to be triggered at any time, for example when
the UNMIT police had to defuse 49 rock-fighting incidents in a single day on
24 October, or when violent incidents, street fighting and house burning suddenly
S/2007/50

increased in Dili on 21 and 22 January, resulting in four murders [Operations_PatrolsInterventions: Implement]. Overall, since
UNMIT’s establishment in late August, 295 cases have been referred to the PNTL
National Investigation Department, including 53 murders, 37 attempted murders, 26
serious assaults and 45 arson incidents, 10 rapes and two sexual assaults of minors.
Of those cases, 256 occurred in Dili and 39 in the rest of the country. This led to 46
arrests. As regards the 57 inmates, including Major Reinado, who escaped from
Becora prison on 30 August, only two convicted prisoners from this group
surrendered to the UNMIT police and are back in prison, while the remaining
escapees, who were pre-trial detainees, are still at large and remain a serious
security concern.";;;;;;;;;;;;Implement;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Investigation Team which will work with the Prosecutor-General to complete the
outstanding investigations into serious crimes committed in 1999 initiated by the
former Serious Crimes Unit [TransitionalJustice: Implement]. In preparation, UNMIT retained five Timorese
specialists to restore the records of the Serious Crimes Unit, which were destroyed
during the violent incidents in May 2006 [TransitionalJustice: Implement]. The report of the Commission for Truth,
Reception and Reconciliation was disseminated in all districts by the Technical
Secretariat that succeeded the Commission which was set up by President Gusmão
on 20 December 2005. The President reiterated his support for the work of the
Technical Secretariat and asked it to continue its work until a follow-on institution

UNMIT_S/2007/50;27;2551;"27. The challenges confronting the judicial system outlined in my previous report
(see S/2006/628, paras. 81-88) continued to impede its effective functioning. In
recent months, arrests in Dili, in particular, have created an additional backlog of
cases. The capacity of the judicial system promptly to deal with its backlog and with
the growing number of cases is limited, requiring it to prioritize the most serious
crimes. A large number of those arrested for lesser offences were released by
judicial authorities owing to capacity limitations as well as to technical deficiencies
in the submission of case files. Increasingly, reports of intimidation of witnesses and
the absence of mechanisms for witness protection are hampering prosecutions.
These factors, coupled with a general lack of understanding among the population
about judicial procedures have contributed to a growing perception that impunity is
tolerated. UNMIT and UNDP are working with national authorities to overcome
these bottlenecks and to facilitate longer-term capacity-building within the justice
system institutions, including through UNDP’s justice support programme [JusticeSectorReform: AssistOther with IA]. This
programme will require additional donor funding, however, if it is to further expand
its activities to respond to evolving needs. UNMIT is in the process of recruiting qualified personnel to initiate, in collaboration with the relevant Timorese
authorities and civil society, the comprehensive judicial review mentioned in my
previous report (see S/2006/628, para. 88) [JusticeSectorReform: AssistOther, CivilSocietyAssistance: Implement].";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;Implement;;;;;;;;;;

Provedor for Human Rights and Justice and relevant non-governmental
organizations to monitor and observe the general human rights situation [HumanRights: Monitor, CivilSocietyAssistance: Implement]. This work
has focused primarily on the rights of persons in detention, although the right to
property and housing has also been a key issue. UNMIT’s ongoing activities to
strengthen the capacity of the Provedor, non-governmental organizations working in
the human rights field and the PNTL are carried out with the support of and in
collaboration with relevant partners in the United Nations system [HumnRights: Assist with IA, CivilSocietyAssistance: Implement with IA]. On 29 November,
the Office of the Provedor, the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for
Human Rights (OHCHR) and UNDP signed a three-year capacity-building project,
to begin in 2007, which will strengthen the ability of the Office of the Provedor to
monitor and protect human rights throughout the country, including of vulnerable
groups such as internally displaced persons, women, children and the elderly. The
United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) provided support on critical issues
related to children, including in the areas of community policing, strengthening of
the Vulnerable Persons Unit and juvenile justice, on which it worked extensively
with the Ministry of Justice, including on the drafting of the children’s code and
other legislative instruments to strengthen compliance with the Convention on the

UNMIT_S/2007/50;22;2548;"22. A number of judicial proceedings in relation to the events of April-May 2006,
some of which had been initiated before the release of the Commission report, were
ongoing. The trial of former Minister of Interior, Rogerio Lobato, charged with
embezzlement, the unlawful use of weapons in the disruption of public order,
manslaughter and attempted manslaughter, and three co-defendants charged with
unauthorized possession of a firearm, commenced on 30 November 2006. It was
immediately adjourned because of the absence of one of the co-defendants. On
28 December, a number of shots were allegedly fired by unknown persons at the
house of one of the main witnesses in this trial. In response, witness protection
measures were put in place by UNMIT police [TransitionalJustice: ProvideSecurity]. The trial resumed on 9 January 2007.
Despite the presence of more than 800 demonstrators in support of the former
Minister on the first day of the trial, proceedings on that and following days went
smoothly. On 12 January 2007, the Dili District Court remanded three members of
the F-FDTL and one PNTL officer into preventive detention in relation to the
shooting of unarmed PNTL officers on 25 May 2006, which had caused the death of
eight PNTL officers and injury to 25 other officers and two UNOTIL police. One
PNTL Deputy District Commander and two PNTL officers are awaiting trial in
detention for illegal possession of firearms, while one civilian, initially placed in
pre-trial detention on a murder charge, was conditionally released by the court and
ordered to report weekly to the police while awaiting trial. UNMIT regularly
monitored the judicial proceedings and provided security as needed [TransitionalJustice: Monitor, ProvideSecurity]. Former Prime
Minister Alkatiri remained under investigation by the Prosecutor-General in relation
to alleged distribution of weapons, but without charges having been brought against

establishing the facts and circumstances relevant to incidents that took place on
28 and 29 April and from 23 to 25 May and related events or issues that contributed

6 07-22304
to the crisis and with clarifying responsibility for those events. In addition, the
Commission was mandated to recommend measures to ensure accountability for
crimes and serious violations of human rights allegedly committed during that
period, taking into account the fact that the Government of Timor-Leste considers
that the domestic justice system should be the primary avenue of accountability. The
report of the Commission (S/2006/822, annex) was first submitted to me, then
presented to the Parliament on 17 October and subsequently widely distributed in
the country. The UNMIT leadership prepared politically for the release of the report
by providing accurate information and clarification on the Commission’s mandate
and the status of its work to relevant institutions and interested parties, as well as to
the public [TransitionalJustice, HumanRights: Outreach, PartyAssistance: Implement]. In addition, in view of widespread speculation of possible negative
reactions after the report’s release, UNMIT, together with the international security

Commander Major Alfredo Reinado, who escaped from Becora Prison with 56
others on 30 August, continued to be a cause for concern, not only because it
symbolized the prevailing sense of impunity, but also because of the prospect that
the issue could be used politically in the electoral campaign. The F-FDTL Command
took steps on behalf of the Government to initiate a dialogue with Major Reinado
aimed at bringing about the cantonment of his armed group in order to reduce the
potential for security problems and enable the judicial process to proceed. A first
meeting between the Commander of the F-FDTL, Brigadier General Taur Matan
Ruak, and Major Reinado was held on 21 December. At the request of the President,
the Prime Minister and the President of Parliament at the high-level coordination

border security agencies to the required level of self-sufficiency. Moreover, the
presence of military liaison officers will continue to be necessary, to facilitate
necessary communication between the two parties, especially so long as a formal
agreement on the border is not reached. In this context, it should be noted that the
military liaison arrangement that is currently in effect between the Indonesian army
and the UNMISET military component will end on 20 May 2005. A successor
arrangement between Indonesia and Timor-Leste, under which the Tactical
Coordination Line would remain in place but the Border Patrol Unit would replace
the UNMISET military component, was presented to both sides in November 2004,
but has not yet been endorsed by either Government. Should neither a final
agreement on the demarcation of the land border, nor a border management
agreement like the military liaison arrangement, be reached by 20 May 2005, there
will be no legal framework to guide border normalization issues. UNMISET will
continue to present the draft military liaison arrangement for consideration by the
two Governments and I would urge them both to give it adequate consideration with

power for law enforcement in Timor-Leste was handed over to the national police.
To this end, the police component has increased its cooperation and coordination not

Development Programme, a project jointly funded by Australia and the United
Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland [PoliceReform: AssistAgents with IA]. Some of the advisers will continue
to assist the national police beyond May 2005. Nevertheless, the development of a
professional police service requires considerable time and it is becoming
increasingly clear that support to this endeavour will continue to be essential after
the Mission’s current mandate expires. In particular, assistance will be required for

work closely with their counterparts in an effort to reduce incidents of misconduct
and human rights abuses and eventually transform the national police into an
impartial and professional police service [PoliceReform: AssistOther, HumanRights: Assist]. A step towards increasing the

accountability and professionalism of the police is the initiative to introduce
UNMISET-trained professional ethics officers in four districts to assist in the
investigation of professional ethics complaints. In addition, the UNMISET Human
Rights Unit has been providing human rights training to regular and specialized
police units, as well as to civil society groups, so as to ensure an adequate level of
human rights awareness within the community and to monitor abuses committed by the police [PoliceReform: AssistAgents, HumanRights: Assist, Implement, CivilSocietyAssistance: Implement].

view at filling any major gaps that remain at the end of the Mission’s mandate
through donations [PoliceReform: Monitor]. The Border Police Unit, in particular, has been severely
hampered in the conduct of its operations by a shortage of communication and
transportation equipment. Support has also been provided to the police
administration through the development of a new personnel database project,

In January, they then began to assist the trainers in the training of all border patrol
officers in their respective border district areas. Additional training on another six
specialized subjects will be provided by the UNMISET military liaison officers, to
further enhance the skills of the border patrol officers. It is expected that by the end
of May 2005, all special units will have self-sustainable trainers with specialized
knowledge in their respective areas. However, the border patrol officers do not yet

the plan in December, only half were able to achieve the desired level of
competence. The second phase of the plan commenced shortly afterwards, focusing
essentially on investigation skills and forensic science. Around 300 police
investigators completed the training at the end of January 2005. Further training is
being planned to consolidate the skills already acquired by police officers and to
allow them to reach the intermediate level by May 2005. A series of training

fully respond to the desire for justice of those affected by the violence of 1999
within the limited time and resources that remain available. It is likely that a
significant number of cases will not have been investigated or prosecuted by 20 May
2005. The indictments filed by the Serious Crimes Unit cover 572 of the estimated
1,400 murders committed in 1999. A number of cases, which have been referred to
the Serious Crimes Unit by the Commission for Reception, Truth and
Reconciliation, involve serious crimes and are thus deemed unsuitable for
reconciliation processes. These cases have not yet been investigated. Formal legal
processes are a crucial aspect of efforts to move beyond the violence that occurred
in 1999 [TransitionalJustice: Monitor]. It is thus essential that all those responsible for the serious crimes
committed in 1999 be held accountable, and that justice be done in the appropriate
manner. As already noted in paragraph 8 above, I have therefore decided to establish
a commission of experts to assess the outcome of the two judicial processes in
Jakarta and Dili and to make appropriate recommendations to me.";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;Monitor;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

persons remain outside Timor-Leste, and it is likely that some of them will return in
the coming years. At present, the Timorese justice system does not have the capacity
to handle cases in which indicted persons were arrested by the authorities upon
returning to the country. While the Government is still developing future plans for
the serious crimes process, UNMISET has taken preliminary measures to assist it in
addressing the issues [JusticeSectorReform: AssistOther]. These include suggestions for legislative amendments,
including changes to the current judicial composition of the Special Panels, so that
the Timorese judges can hear the cases with little or no international participation [JusticeSectorReform: AssistPolicies, AssistOther, LegalReform: Assist]. In addition, the Serious Crimes Unit provides training to 21 national police officers

additional 13 indictments involving 42 accused persons, including the suspected

institutions continued to assist in the drafting and review laws, as well as the
provision of legal advice [LegalReform: Assist]. Timorese reliance on their assistance to draft key
legislation and ensure the harmonization of draft laws with existing legislation
remains significant. In addition, the shortage of legally trained Timorese

the provision of international judges has partially reduced the backlog of pending
cases in the district courts, the operation of these district courts remains sporadic

key routine tasks such as the closing of monthly and quarterly accounts, payroll
operations and budget execution activities and to use computer software has been
consolidated. It is expected that a national counterpart will be appointed shortly to
the post of Director of the Treasury, currently filled by an UNMISET adviser [StateAdministration: Implement].
However, the assistance of the advisers continues to be essential for the performance
of more complex operations such as the coordination of multiple activities,

shown by the preliminary results of a survey on future advisory support
requirements by Timor-Leste institutions conducted in December 2004 and January
2005, as well as a recent assessment of progress in capacity development conducted
by the mission’s Civilian Support Group. With only the support of UNMISET
civilian advisers, for example, Timorese officials have been able to develop a range
of sector investment programmes which set out development objectives, policies
and programmes for 17 key sectors, as well as related expenditure priorities for the

administration and institution-building of the justice sector reviewed the need for
the 58 “most critical” adviser positions, currently funded by UNMISET [JusticeSectorReform: MaterialSupport], beyond
May 2005. The findings of the groups indicate that while local capacity has been
built and institutional self-sufficiency greatly enhanced, there is still in some cases,
especially in the legal and justice sectors, significant reliance on the international
advisers to perform both line functions and to supervise the work of Timorese
counterparts. In this connection, the retention of the 15 “most critical” adviser posts
in the justice sector was considered vital to the continued functioning of the courts
beyond May 2005, given the acute shortage of qualified national judges and the
related need for Timorese judicial personnel to complete the two-and-a-half-year

with the request of the Security Council, in resolution 1573 (2004), for greater
Timorese involvement and ownership of the three programme areas of the Mission’s

Government, UNMISET, United Nations agencies and Bretton Woods institutions,
non-governmental organizations and other bilateral and multilateral partners. While
the findings and conclusions of the working groups do not necessarily represent a
consensus of all participants, they reflect an objective assessment of the key
concerns remaining in the areas covered by the UNMISET mandate, namely the
development of a professional police service, the deficiencies of the Timorese
security sector and the overall capacity development of State and Government
institutions, including the development of a functioning justice sector [PoliceReform, JusticeSectorReform, StateAdministration, MilitaryReform: Meeting with IA]. Also

UNMISET consolidation phase, Timor-Leste had not yet reached the critical
threshold of self-sufficiency. The public administration — particularly the finance,
banking and justice sectors — remains weak and fragile. Some of the 58 UNMISET
civilian advisers who provide most critical support, and should by now be serving as
mentors, continue to perform line functions in key institutions today. In the area of
law enforcement, PNTL still faces serious formidable challenges, including a lack of
professional skills and values, policing experience, necessary equipment and
infrastructure, and management and coordination capabilities. Further training is
essential to bring it up to the desired level of professionalism, competence and
skills. The key role played by the UNMISET civilian police advisers in providing
training and mentoring of PNTL remains indispensable [PoliceReform: AssistAgents]. For training programmes
currently under way to be fully implemented and completed by May 2005, it will be
necessary to retain the authorized strength of 157 civilian police for the coming six
months. With regard to support to the security and stability of Timor-Leste, the
country’s border with Indonesia remains to be defined. While bilateral relations
between Indonesia and Timor-Leste have improved, particularly at the highest level,
the 42 military liaison officers are required to facilitate contacts between the border
security agencies and to monitor security-related developments. This small
international presence along the border, supported by the UNMISET military
component, which has an authorized strength of 435, continues to be regarded as an
important confidence-building mechanism by the Timorese population [BorderControl: Assist].

component is already at its bare minimum, it will be necessary to retain the 477
authorized military personnel for the next six months. The military component will
continue to carry out the tasks mandated by the Security Council to promote
security and stability in Timor-Leste. The 42 military liaison officers will continue
to facilitate contacts between the Timorese and Indonesian border security agencies
and monitor security-related developments along the border [BorderControl: Assist]., the 310-strong security
force will continue to provide protection to the military liaison officers and other
United Nations personnel in the country and maintain a reassuring presence. The
125-person International Response Unit will continue to undertake preventive and
response operations in exceptional circumstances. While this assistance will be
available until May 2005, it is imperative that Timor-Leste and Indonesia take the
opportunity to intensify their efforts, including at the highest levels, to conclude an
agreement on land border demarcation as early as possible. Pending such an
agreement, the adoption of an interim arrangement would be necessary to facilitate
the management of the border.";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;Assist;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

slower than expected and therefore many of the factors that warrant the presence of
the UNMISET military component have not changed. Despite the efforts made,
Timor-Leste and Indonesia have not reached final agreement on the demarcation of
their land border. The Timorese border security agencies have not yet gained
sufficient capacity to manage the border affairs alone, neither have they reached the
point where they can interact with the Indonesian border security agencies on their
own without facilitation of the UNMISET military component [BorderControl: Assist]. As the national
police force is gaining skills and experience, its ability to meet security challenges
has improved, but not to the level of providing protection and evacuation to the
military liaison officers of UNMISET. The possibility of exceptional circumstances

frequent patrols in the border areas, the military component continues to assist the
development of the defence force through its skills and knowledge transfer
programme to pass on technical and practical skills as well as operational
experience [Operations_PatrolsInterventions: Implement, MilitaryReform: AssistAgents]. Five training modules, covering the areas of military policing,

efforts on contributing to the transformation of PNTL into a non-political, impartial
and professional police service by providing training and mentoring with the aim to
improve the professional and technical capacity of the national police to the
requisite levels in accordance with international standards. They will remain
co-located with their Timorese counterparts in national police headquarters, in all

would need to be complemented by other bilateral and multilateral assistance
programmes. Necessary measures to be taken by the Government include the early
adoption of related legislation such as a penal code and a criminal procedures code
and various acts on immigration, transnational crime, firearms and explosives.
Continuous emphasis on the need for discipline and self-control of police officers

coaching and mentoring to one geared towards institutional capacity development [StateAdministration: Assist].
With a view to the completion of the Mission’s mandate in May 2005, the advisers
promote increased ownership by State institutions throughout all capacity
development steps through the direct involvement and participation of the Capacity
Development Coordination Unit under the Office of the Prime Minister. Capacity
development activities focus on three areas in particular: skills and knowledge,
systems and processes, and attitudes and behaviour. Concrete action plans are being
finalized to guide activities in the coming period. Together with the State
institutions, the advisers are formulating exit strategies to ensure sustainability of
support after the end of the UNMISET mandate. This will involve identifying
partners to provide assistance beyond May 2005.

additional 7 were under recruitment, largely for lack of the necessary funding.
I would encourage bilateral and multilateral partners to increase their contributions

development of PNTL, beyond the UNMISET mandate, international civilian police
have maintained a particular focus on training Timorese trainers [PoliceReform: AssistAgents]. For that purpose, a
training needs survey was conducted in June 2004 to ascertain progress made so far
and to identify weak areas that require further reinforcement [PoliceReform: Monitor]. The result of the
survey, in which nearly two thirds of PNTL members participated, were used to
prepare a skills development plan according to which UNMISET police will train
PNTL trainers at the station level. Those trainers will then conduct training at the
sub-station level. The result of the training will be evaluated through test exercises.

the peacekeeping force has been reconfigured to enable
it to continue to promote stability both along the border

Civil aviation has seen the arrival of a new head, and a

to the airport’s runway, communications and passenger
terminals has attracted new passenger services, and
fares to certain destinations have been reduced as a
result of increased competition. The port of Dili can

vehicles a month and is bringing in significant revenue
to the Transitional Administration. Post and
telecommunication services continue to improve, with
wider access to telephones and agreements with
Australia and Portugal to facilitate international postal
traffic. The Border Service revenue collection has
surpassed estimates by almost 40 per cent for the first

However, the periods following the election and during
the formation of the first Government of independent
East Timor may also require particular vigilance.
UNTAET is seeking to address this issue by
emphasizing the principle of tolerance for different

the repair of the infrastructure, quick-impact projects
have been carried out throughout the country [StateAdministration: Implement with IA]. Thirty
thousand persons have been employed under projects
overseen by the United States Agency for International

US$ 1.3 million in reconstruction projects (mainly road
rehabilitation) which have also provided temporary

sectors following last year’s violence, in conjunction
with large-scale destruction, had a devastating effect on
the economy. The gross domestic product (GDP) is
estimated to have shrunk in 1999 by as much as 38 per
cent. Unemployment soared, especially in the urban
areas. The prices of fuel and other basic goods rose
steeply, in part reflecting the removal of subsidies. UNTAET is trying to normalize border trade with West

exploitation of petroleum in the “Timor Gap” region of
the Timor Sea. In early February, to ensure the
continued and smooth commercial development of the
Timor Gap, UNTAET signed a Memorandum of
Understanding with Australia in which UNTAET, on
behalf of East Timor, agreed to continue the terms of
the Treaty between Australia and the Republic of
Indonesia on the Zone of Cooperation in an Area
between the Indonesian Province of East Timor and
Northern Australia (Timor Gap Treaty) [Resource: Implement with IA]. This was
without prejudice to position of the future government
of an independent East Timor. In consultation with the
East Timorese leaders, UNTAET has been in touch
with the Government of Australia, with a view to
working out a new legal regime that would come into
force at independence.";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;Implement,InternationalActor;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

was limited in the first months of the mission because
of normal delays as programmes were being planned,
with expenses being met by other agencies as part of
relief programmes, and difficulties in the procurement
of certain goods and services, as well as limitations of
port and warehouse capacity. These obstacles have
essentially been overcome. Disbursements from the
UNTAET Trust Fund so far total over US$ 3 million on
civil service salaries, quick-impact projects and

of East Timorese society. The programme aims
to promote civic education, constitutional development,

urgent policy decisions must be made in a multitude of areas. At the same time,
there are urgent humanitarian needs and public services requirements. UNTAET
has established the basic elements of an administrative structure and is
actively coordinating humanitarian assistance efforts [StateAdministration, HumanitarianRelief: Implement]. The devastating effects
of the systematic destruction and violence last September, however, and the
consequent cessation of civil and public services will continue to be serious
impediments for the foreseeable future. Moreover, widespread unemployment and
the disruption of the education system and other social and public services,
combined with the very high prices of food and other daily necessities, bear the
potential for serious social problems. It will therefore be a high priority in
the next three months to produce tangible results for the people of East Timor
by creating employment and providing a range of public services, while
supporting the reintegration of displaced persons from West Timor. Expanding
trade will be important in order to increase supply and lower prices.";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;Implement;;;;;;;;;;;;Implement;;;;

UNMOT_S/1997/198;16;2193;"16. On 26 February, my Special Representative opened the Moscow round of
inter-Tajik talks in the presence of representatives from the observer countries
and organizations. The Government's delegation was led by Foreign Minister
Talbak Nazarov, and the UTO delegation by Mr. Akbar Turajonzodah, First Deputy
Chairman of UTO. Both sides presented working papers on military issues, that
is, the reform of the government power structures (armed forces, police,
security) and the disarmament and reintegration of the UTO forces into those
structures or civilian life [MilitaryReform, PoliceReform, DisarmamentDemobilization, Reintegration: Meeting]. The talks began in a business-like manner and
possible compromises could be discerned on a number of issues. However, they
proceeded under the shadow of the possible suspension of the talks by the
delegation of UTO, owing to the arrest of five opposition members by the
Government (see para. 11 above). On 3 March, the talks were interrupted for two
days in order to allow a member of the UTO delegation to travel to Dushanbe and
visit the detainees. The Government also allowed ICRC and UNMOT access to the
detainees.

provinces in Cambodia. Between 23 and 25 May, some 1,400 large, medium and
small fixed polling stations were operating, as well as 200 mobile teams in
remote or difficult country. The mobile teams operated for the entire six-day
period, while on 26 May some of the fixed stations were converted to mobile
operation and worked as mobile teams on 27 and 28 May. Polling took place from
0800 to 1600 hours each day, but was extended on the final day to accommodate
the remaining voters. Aside from a few incidents, described below, polling was
conducted in a peaceful and often festive atmosphere, with voters sometimes
walking several miles to cast their ballots, apparently undaunted by threats of
violence or banditry, rough terrain or the heavy rain that swept much of the
country. As indicated in my report issued in pursuance of paragraph 6 of
Security Council resolution 810 (1993) (S/25784), the UNTAC Military and
Civilian Police components ensured tight security for the poll throughout [ElectoralSecurity: Implement].

Cambodia is likely to be affected by continuing violence, although UNTAC will
continue to do its utmost in providing security measures [ElectoralSecurity: Implement]. Unfortunately, this
is a feature in many other countries even when elections are held in far more
favourable conditions, rather than in the wake of a prolonged and bitter
conflict that has left a legacy of tensions and deep distrust as is the case in
Cambodia. As noted in paragraph 140 of my fourth progress report, it would be
unrealistic to hold Cambodia to standards valid in countries that enjoy
stability or established democratic traditions. UNTAC, therefore, will be
conducting the most impartial election that is possible in conditions that are
not susceptible to its full control. It would be ingenuous to expect that a
postponement would bring improved conditions - the contrary is more probable.";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;Implement;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

anticipated in the Paris Agreements. This results from the unfortunate attitude
of PDK, which, having progressively withdrawn from the peace process starting
with the military provisions, has now moved from boycotting the election to
attempts to actively disrupt it through violence. Such actions constitute a
clear breach of solemn commitments. I am certain that the members of the

occurred since the issuance of the fourth progress report on UNTAC. On

casualties have resulted from attacks on civilians and on SOC by NADK and by

even a carefully prepared election especially through their destabilizing
psychological effects. Following the killing of a United Nations Volunteer
serving as a District Electoral Supervisor and his interpreter in Kompong Thom
Province on 8 April, some 60 United Nations Volunteers have withdrawn from their
posts. Since document S/25669, in which I reported on a number of incidents of
attacks against UNTAC personnel, and my fourth progress report (S/25719) were
issued, the security situation in Cambodia has been marked by further acts of
violence. While it is not possible to classify all acts of violence or to
determine who was responsible, there are essentially four categories of
violence: (a) killings of Cambodians, including those of Vietnamese ancestry,
by the forces of PDK, the National Army of Democratic Kampuchea (NADK), in an
effort both to disrupt the election and, evidently, to pressure those of
Vietnamese ancestry to leave Cambodia., (b) attacks and harassment by SOC
elements aimed at intimidating other political parties, primarily FUNCINPEC.,

the way originally envisaged. The events since March make it prudent to assume
that further violence is likely against individual Cambodians, against political
parties and against UNTAC personnel. The danger is that such attacks will have
an impact on the voter turnout. UNTAC has been tightening security measures in
the provinces most affected [ElectoralSecurity: Implement]. However, such measures could also lower the

be politically motivated are made difficult by the second-hand or unreliable
nature of many of the allegations, the inadequacy of record keeping by the local
authorities and the inadequate resources available to UNTAC to investigate and
follow up allegations that are made. None the less, it can be said that the
level of politically motivated violence has fallen since the high point reached
in December 1992, that the level for the month of April so far tends to indicate
a further fall and that this decline can be attributed at least in part to
efforts directly undertaken by UNTAC as well as actions taken by the local
authorities at UNTAC’s urging [ElectoralSecurity: Monitor, Implement, Advocate, PartyAssistance: Monitor]. Whether that apparent improvement is real, and
whether it can be sustained during the election campaign, has yet to be seen.";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;Monitor,Implement,Advocate;;;Monitor;;;;;;;;;;;

On the basis of complaints made by political parties as well as reports from

political activity, including allegations of harassment and intimidation as well
as murders and armed attacks. Verbal threats and intimidation, including such
acts as tearing down posters and notice-boards, have also occurred. Verbal

many of them by boat down the Tonle Sap and the Bassac River. UNTAC naval units

Freedom of association with political parties and human rights groups,

by the surveillance conducted by the authorities of the Cambodian parties at all

Representative signed on 17 March 1993 a directive prohibiting the possession
and carrying of firearms and explosives by unauthorized persons [ControlSALW: Implement]. After a
three-week amnesty during which such persons were permitted to hand in
prohibited materials, offenders were to be subject to terms of imprisonment and
to the confiscation of weapons and explosives in their possession. The
directive has proved very effective as a crime control measure both in
Phnom Penh and in the provinces. Joint checkpoints manned by UNTAC Civilian
Police and the local police since 5 April 1993 have resulted in the confiscation
of a total of 71 high-powered firearms such as AK-47 rifles, 65 low-powered
firearms such as pistols and revolvers, 7 rocket launchers and hundreds of
rounds of assorted ammunition [ControlSALW: Assist]. In Phnom Penh, 14 random checkpoints are mounted
each day and an average of about 15 firearms are confiscated each week. These
are stored for a time to enable the holders to justify their possession by
producing documents and, if this is not done, eventually destroyed. This has
led to a significant decrease in reported crime in Phnom Penh. Serious crimes
of all kinds, including murder, rape, armed robbery, the causing of explosions
and the illegal discharge of firearms, totalled 66 in January and rose to 82 in
February. In March the total fell to 65, and the April total was 35.

Civilian Police Component in collaboration with other UNTAC components launched
a special operation to curb the attacks. All political party offices were
regularly visited and checked by 24-hour Civilian Police patrols. There are now
more than 600 offices, and it would not be possible for UNTAC with its limited
resources to provide security for all of them. Protection methods have
therefore been refined in close cooperation with the parties concerned. A list
of 60 party offices considered to be most at risk was drawn up and the UNTAC
Civilian Police and Military components provided protection, initially on a
24-hour-a-day basis and then during the hours of darkness only [PartyAssistance: ProvideSecurity, Operations-PatrolsIntervetions: Implement]. Since then, no
office thus guarded has been attacked and the number of attacks against offices

great majority of the Cambodian people, are, therefore, hampered by political
considerations in that direct support for the currency would be seen as
partiality towards the Phnom Penh authorities. On the other hand, the economic
and social difficulties caused by rapid and severe inflation would obviously
have negative implications for the environment in which elections are to be
held, particularly given the damage already caused to that environment by the
acts of violence described above. UNTAC has, therefore, taken measures to
introduce additional rice supplies into the market to discourage hoarding and to
bring down the price in an effort to avert social unrest [EconomicDevelopment: Implement]. However, it may take
some time to accomplish this.";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;Implement;;;;;

become extremely unstable, with the exchange rate falling from about 2,500 riels
to the United States dollar to more than 4,000. This instability has been
accompanied by a steep rise in prices, particularly of rice, which now costs
three or four times what it did before the slump in the riel. The fluctuations
in the value of the riel cannot be attributed to any action or error on the part
of the Phnom Penh financial authorities, whose operations are closely controlled
and supervised by UNTAC [StateAdministration: Assist]., nor has UNTAC been able to ascertain the economic
reasons for the fluctuations. However, it does appear that the other three
Cambodian parties - PDK, FUNCINPEC and KPNLF - are unwilling to support the
riel, whose collapse would have serious implications for the Phnom Penh
authorities.";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;Assist;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

existing administrative structures in the implementation of the Penal Code
adopted by the SNC in September 1992 on UNTAC’s initiative. This phase of
training followed earlier phases in which about 200 judges, prosecutors and

UNTAC civil administration control over the five areas specified in the Paris
Agreements - foreign affairs, national defence, public security, finance and
information - has been the activity of the Control Team, established in
January 1993. The Control Team supplements the regular supervision that UNTAC
exercises over the existing administrative structures, particularly outside
Phnom Penh, which otherwise would tend to be inadequate because of the

requirements for CMAC’s short-term plan of operations has been widely

under investigation by the SITs were Vietnamese and that they had served with
the Vietnamese armed forces in Cambodia., they were, therefore, ""foreign forces""
within the meaning of the definition approved by SNC at its meeting on
20 October 1992. Two of the men were serving with CPAF and the third was a
former member. All three had been issued identity cards by the Phnom Penh
authorities. Therefore, UNTAC asked the Phnom Penh authorities to discharge the
two still serving from their armed forces and to withdraw the identity cards of
all three men [Demilitarization: Advocate]. UNTAC also requested the Government of Viet Nam to accept the
three men back as Vietnamese nationals, but the latter has so far declined to do
so. A further four men have since been identified as ""foreign forces"" and the

reinforcing its defensive positions all over Cambodia, particularly in Siem Reap

construction of bunkers and overhead protection as well as firing bays, which
are defensive pits from which soldiers can return fire. Where UNTAC assets are
located in isolated locations, permanent guards and/or mobile patrols are used
to improve the physical security of the premises. Security at UNTAC
headquarters has also been strengthened by heightening the walls around the
compound, tightening control over approaching traffic, improving the
illumination along the walls and instituting better verification of the

has reported, in respect of the incident of 8 April in Kompong Thom Province,
that evidence appeared to rule out the involvement of any Cambodian faction as

in Pailin has been a matter of concern. For some time NADK has frequently
confined the military observers and other staff to their houses while preventing
UNTAC from resupplying them with fuel, preventing resupply by air and creating
obstacles to their replacement and rotation. Despite my Special
Representative’s repeated protests to Mr. Khieu Samphan, President of PDK, these
measures have not been relaxed [HostilityGovernment: Physical]. UNTAC has endeavoured to maintain their
deployment in Pailin as long as possible while continuing its efforts to

Military Component has concluded agreements for providing security for the
polling period with the armed forces of the three factions which are in
compliance with the peace process SOC, FUNCINPEC and KPNLF [ElectoralSecurity: AssistOther]. The central feature
of these arrangements is that the security of the polling stations and their
vicinity will be provided by UNTAC alone. UNTAC will be solely responsible for
all security measures to be taken in the immediate vicinity of a polling
station, as well as United Nations personnel and property. The armed forces of
the factions will be responsible for assisting UNTAC, conveying information on
possible or actual threats to the election and ensuring security in the zones

electoral supervisor, a Japanese national and a Cambodian interpreter has raised
concern about security. The 465 United Nations Volunteers who serve as district
electoral supervisors, deployed throughout the country, have played a vital role
in the training of Cambodian electoral staff and in the programme of civic
education about the election in the countryside as well as in convincing the
electorate that their vote will be secret [ElectionAssistance, VoterEducation: Implement]. Following the incident of 8 April,
UNTAC has instituted emergency provisional arrangements to improve security.
All United Nations Volunteers, including district electoral supervisors, in 10
central and western provinces considered to present security risks were
instructed to withdraw from the countryside and not to travel without an armed

Component. These modifications have been described in detail in earlier reports
listed above. As reported earlier, PDK’s non-cooperation made it necessary for
UNTAC to suspend the cantonment of the armed forces of the three other factions,
after some 55,000 troops had been disarmed under UNTAC supervision [DDR: started but stopped], and the
Military Component, in close cooperation with the Civilian Police and other
components of UNTAC, has redirected its efforts to ensuring the security of the
electoral process and the safety of the Cambodian political parties and of UNTAC
staff under conditions of instability which are not in consonance with the

UNTAC_S/25719;4;2023;"4. The main obstacle to the implementation of UNTAC’s mandate since its
establishment in Cambodia on 15 March 1992 has been the refusal of one of the
parties, the Party of Democratic Kampuchea (PDK), to meet the obligations it
assumed in signing the Paris Peace Agreements. That Party has neither
demobilized its armed forces, nor has it granted UNTAC personnel access to the
zones it controls in the thinly populated north and west of the country [HostilityGovernment: Physical]. To the
contrary, in violation of the cease-fire it has sought to extend the territory
it controls and has blown up bridges and carried out other military operations.
On many occasions its units in the field have temporarily detained United
Nations military observers and other UNTAC personnel [HostilityGovernment: Physical], all of whom were, however,
released unharmed after negotiation. PDK Radio has launched increasingly
vitriolic attacks on UNTAC [HostilityGovernment: Verbal] and its senior officials and has directed violent
propaganda against Vietnamese-speaking persons living in Cambodia. Members of
the National Army of Democratic Kampuchea (NADK), the armed forces of PDK, have

progress has been made in implementing resolution 792 (1992). Dates have been
set for a constituent assembly election in May, and UNTAC is proceeding on
schedule with electoral preparations in all areas of Cambodia to which it had
access as at 31 January 1993 [ElectionAssistance: Implement]., the Supreme National Council has resumed
meetings in Phnom Penh under the chairmanship of His Royal Highness
Prince Norodom Sihanouk., measures are being taken to prevent the supply of
petroleum to PDK, since it has failed to comply with the military provisions
of the Paris Agreements., and UNTAC has strengthened its border control system
and its monitoring of compliance with the provisions relating to the export of
logs [BorderControl: Implement, Resources: Monitor]. In the last-mentioned matter, UNTAC has requested full cooperation from
neighbouring States, and expects that such cooperation will be forthcoming so

the new Government, there are broadly two possibilities:
(a) All four Cambodian parties agree, belatedly, to implement the
cantonment and demobilization procedures provided for in annex 2 of the Paris
Agreement.,
(b) All four parties, to a greater or lesser extent, maintain their
forces in the field, as at present, and UNTAC continues to use its best
endeavours to ensure that the cease-fire is respected.
In either case, the maintenance of law and order would remain the
responsibility of the civil police of the existing administrative structures,
under the supervision and control of UNTAC [PoliceReform: AssistOther, StateAdministration: Assist].";;;;;;;;;;Assist,AssistOther;;;;;;;;;;;Assist;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

campaign. According to the implementation plan (S/23613), the duration of the
campaign was set tentatively at six weeks, beginning in early March. However,
now that the date of the election has been set for late May, it is necessary

either to extend the campaign or to start later. Divergent considerations
bear on this question. The longer the campaign goes on, the greater the risk
that it may be marred by interparty violence. On the other hand, a short
campaign may give an advantage to one party to the detriment of others. At
the 10 February Supreme National Council meeting, therefore, UNTAC announced
that it had decided that the campaign would begin on 7 April 1993 and last
until 19 May 1993, when a four-day cooling-off period would take place before
polling [ElectionAssistance: Meeting]. UNTAC would make its information and broadcasting facilities
available to all political parties in order to ensure fair access to the media.";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;Meeting;;;;;;;;;;;;;

political parties had applied for official party registration in accordance
with the Electoral Law. The official registration process involves the
submission of the names and voter registration numbers of 5,000 registered
voters who are members of the party concerned. The Electoral Component is now
in the process of verifying those names and numbers [ElectionAssistance, PartyAssistance: Implement]. When verification is
complete, the names of the parties that have successfully completed the
registration procedure will be announced and those parties will be entitled to
appear on the ballot paper. The Cambodian People's Party (SOC), FUNCINPEC and
the Buddhist Liberal Democratic Party (Khmer People's National Liberation
Front (KPNLF)), representing three of the four Cambodian parties which were
signatories to the Paris Agreements, have applied for official registration
but, as noted above, PDK did not do so. The name of that party will therefore
not appear on the ballot paper. The registered parties have been requested to
name lists of candidates for each province.

areas such as customs and immigration control. The 23 check points now in
operation are each manned by an UNTAC team comprising military observers,

paragraph 14 of resolution 792 (1992), the adoption by the Supreme National
Council of a moratorium on the export of minerals and gems from Cambodia, to
enter into force as from 28 February 1993 [Resources: Advocate]. This draft declaration, amended on
the proposal of FUNCINPEC to include the commercial extraction of mineral
resources onshore and offshore, had received the support of three of the four
Cambodian parties in the Technical Advisory Committee, but objections were
expressed by PDK. The question was raised again at the Supreme National
Council meeting on 10 February 1993, and it was decided to adopt the
moratorium despite continued objection by PDK.";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;Advocate;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Mr. Khieu Samphan, President of PDK, in a renewed effort to secure his party's
cooperation with UNTAC. Mr. Akashi recalled the relevant provisions of
Security Council resolution 792 (1992), especially paragraph 5, which stated
that UNTAC should proceed to conduct free and fair elections in all parts of
Cambodia to which it had full acces·s as at 31 January 1993. He stressed that
the elections were designed to produce a peaceful, stable and united Cambodia
and that it was in the long-term interests of PDK to take part [ElectionAssistance: Meeting]. However,
Mr. Khieu Samphan insisted that the conditions stated by his party - the
removal of foreign forces from Cambodia, the granting of greater powers to the
Supreme National Council and full UNTAC control over the five areas of foreign
affairs, national defence, public security, finance and information specified
in the Paris Agreements - be fulfilled before his party would join the peace
process.";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;Meeting;;;;;;;;;;;;;
UNTAC_S/25289;17;2013;"17. Maintenance of a neutral political environment has also been tested by a
propaganda campaign by the Phnom Penh administration against UNTAC through
television, radio and the party newspaper. While attacks against UNTAC on the
POK radio have been common and have become increasingly hostile for several
months [HostilityGovernment: Verbal], the SOC campaign began fairly recently. The motive appears to be to
spread the message that only SOC can defend the country against POK and so
deserves electoral support, while UNTAC cannot be trusted to protect
Cambodians. In fact, the Military Component has strengthened its
anti-banditry patrols in the remoter parts of the country and reinforced its
support for other components and for the electoral process [Operations_PatrolsInterventions: Implement]. It is deployed in
some 270 locations throughout Cambodia. Military patrols are also
supplementing the other measures taken by UNTAC to protect political party
offices deemed to be at risk of attack [Operations_PatrolsInterventions: Implement, PartyAssistance: ProvideSecurity]. Civic action programmes undertaken by
the Military Component in the more remote regions of the countryside reinforce
these messages of UNTAC's commitment to the Cambodian people.";;;;;;;;;;;;Implement;;;;;;;;;;;;;;ProvideSecurity;;;;;;;;;;;

in January, Mr. Chea Sim, president of the ""national assembly"" of SOC, called
on the local authorities to take all necessary measures to protect offices of
political parties, thwart all forms of criminal activity and safeguard public
security. My Special Representative has urged leaders of all political
parties to help to create in the minds of their followers tolerance for
peaceful political competition and to ensure adherence to the code of conduct
during the forthcoming political campaign [PartyAssistance, ElectoralSecurity: Advocate].";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;Advocate;;;Advocate;;;;;;;;;;;
UNTAC_S/25289;15;2011;"15. As described in my third progress report (para. 103), my Special
Representative established on 6 January a special UNTAC office with powers to
arrest, detain and prosecute persons accused of politically motivated criminal
acts and human rights violations [HumanRights: Implement]. UNTAC has since instituted proceedings
against two suspects arrested by it and now held in its custody [HumanRights: Implement]. The first is
a police officer of SOC, who has been charged with the murder of a FUNCINPEC
party official [PoliceReform: Implement]. The second is a member of NAOK, who is charged, on the basis
of his confession, with the murder of 13 ethnic-Vietnamese Cambodians and
2 other Cambodians [MilitaryReform: Implement].";;;;;;;Implement;;;Implement;Implement;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

continue. Late at night on 12 January, an armed band of some 40 men attacked
the village of Phum Angkrong in Siem Reap Province, killing three Cambodians,
including two UNTAC electoral workers. My Special Representative condemned
the attack, which was carried out by persons unknown. On 27 January 1993,
approximately 3 kilometres north-east of Phum Angkrong, about 10 to 15 armed
assailants killed 8 Cambodians - 4 men and 4 women - and injured 12 others.
UNTAC Civilian Police are investigating these attacks amid indications that
NAOK elements may have been responsible for both of them [MilitaryReform: Monitor].

UNTAC_S/25289;13;2009;"13. Scores of incidents of political or ethnic violence, which have resulted
in some 60 deaths since August 1992, as well as acts of harassment and
intimidation, have also been reported to UNTAC officials. Responsibility for
the killings of Vietnamese-speaking persons has generally been attributed to
NADK elements, while investigations carried out by UNTAC indicate that the
great majority of attacks on political party offices and members are
attributed to soldiers, police or supporters of SOC [PartyAssistance, MilitaryReform, PoliceReform: Monitor]. The broad picture that
emerges from the figures is that incidents of violence and intimidation peaked
in December 1992, after rising through October and November, but fell
significantly in January 1993. However, political violence seems to have
increased somewhat in early February with the detention of four members of the
Front uni national pour un Cambodige independent, neutre, pratique et
cooperatif (FUNCINPEC) in Battambang and an attack on Bakan district, Pursat

local civilians. UNTAC premises and property were also damaged in the attack [HostilityOther: Violent],
but there were no UNTAC casualties. Many of the incidents have been
concentrated in the provinces of Battambang and Kompong Cham, and the victims
in the vast majority of cases were members of FUNCINPEC.";;;;;;;;;;Monitor;Monitor;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;Monitor;;;;;;;;;;;

into which threats to public order in Cambodia can be divided: politically
motivated attacks on political party offices and staff., attacks on
Vietnamese-speaking persons., and killings that seem to have no particular
political motivation but which spread a climate of fear and intimidation.
Subsequent paragraphs of that report described the violent incidents that had
occurred, as well as the measures undertaken by UNTAC to counter them. On
1 February 1993, as a further refinement of these measures, UNTAC Civilian
Police, in consultation with the Military Component and with the cooperation
of the Cambodian police, instituted static guarding of political party offices
considered to be most at risk during the hours of darkness, when attacks are
most likely [PartyAssistance: ProvideSecurity].

virtual house arrest. These restrictions have eased somewhat following UNTAC

protests, but the situation is not yet satisfactory. My Special

UNTAC_S/25289;7;2006;"7. Since my third progress report, the Cambodian People's Armed Forces
(CPAF), the army of the Party of the State of Cambodia (SOC}, have launched
attacks on the National Army of Democratic Kampuchea (NADK), the armed forces
of PDK, in a number of districts. Exchanges of artillery and mortar fire
between CPAF and NADK as well as movements of troops by the two forces have
also occurred. These activities focused on two broad areas: west-central
Battambang province and north-western Kompong Thom/south-central Preah Vihear
provinces. Smaller actions have taken place in Kratie and Siem Reap
provinces. Using combinations of artillery, armoured vehicles and tanks, CPAF
has drawn closer to the POK-held district town of Pailin in the province of
Battambang. UNTAC has protested these moves which, taken together, constitute
a serious cease-fire violation. My Special Representative has called on SOC
to desist from violating the cease-fire and to exercise self-restraint. CPAF
has since drawn back from the furthest point of its advance and, while tension
persists and cease-fire violations continue to occur, the situation is now
calmer. Mr. Hun Sen has called for UNTAC forces to interpose themselves
between the two sides as a ""buffer zone"", but this could be done only with the
consent and cooperation of both parties. PDK has reiterated its position that
it will not permit UNTAC to establish itself in its zone unless its conditions
for joining the peace process are met [HostilityGovernment: Verbal].";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

maintain the neutral political environment needed for the holding of free and
fair elections. The measures recently announced by my Special Representative
to deter attacks against political party offices and to arrest and prosecute
those thought to be responsible for acts of violence, in combination with some
other measures under consideration by UNTAC, should contribute to improving
the political atmosphere in the country and promoting a climate of security
and stability [PartyAssistance: Implement].";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;Implement;;;;;;;;;;;
UNTAC_S/25124;107;2003;"107. On the other hand, there have been a number of negative developments that
have created obstacles to the full implementation of the Paris Agreements. As
the members of the Security Council are aware, PDK's refusal to participate in
the second phase of the cease-fire has made it impossible for UNTAC to carry
out the cantonment, disarmament and demobilization of the factions' armed
forces [DDR: Stopped]. The continuing existence of large and sometimes undisciplined armies,
as well as attempts by some of them to improve their positions on the ground,
has had an adverse effect on the security situation in the country. There has
been an increase in violations of the cease-fire, and there have also been a
number of attacks on UNTAC personnel and helicopters [HostilityGovernment: Physical, Violent]. Last month, for the
first time, members of the UNTAC Military Component were temporarily detained
by elements of NADK in three separate incidents.";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
UNTAC_S/25124;105;2002;"105. On the positive side, there is no doubt that the voter registration
exercise has been a remarkable success. It also demonstrates that the
overwhelming majority of the Cambodian people support the peace process and
UNTAC's efforts to implement the mandate entrusted to it under the Paris
Agreements. It testifies to the confidence of the Cambodian people in the
democratic process. In accordance with its mandate and with paragraph 5 of
Security Council resolution 792 (1992), UNTAC will therefore continue to make
every effort to prepare for the holding of free and fair elections by
May 1993, in all areas of Cambodia to which it has access as at
31 January 1993 [ElectionAssistance: Implement]. I sincerely hope that all parties will respect the
unmistakable wish of the Cambodian people to be given the opportunity to
decide freely their own future, in a peaceful and secure environment.";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;Implement;;;;;;;;;;;;;

instituted intensive patrols and static guard duty to improve the security of
political party offices thought to be most vulnerable to attack, and these
measures were further refined early in January 1993 [Operations_PatrolsInterventions: Implement, PartyAssistance: ProvideSecurity]. On 6 January, in
accordance with articles 6 and 16 and sections Band E of annex I of the Paris
Agreements, my Special Representative issued a directive establishing
procedures for the prosecution of persons responsible for human rights
violations [HumanRights: Implement]. Pursuant to this directive, UNTAC has assumed powers to arrest,
detain and prosecute suspects in cases involving serious human rights
violations. These powers will be exercised in accordance with the Provisions
relating to the Judiciary and Criminal Law and Procedure Applicable in
Cambodia during the Transitional Period, which were adopted by the Supreme
National Council on 10 September 1992.

found in shallow graves in Battambang and Kompong Cham provinces. The
victims, all young men, were bound and they had been stabbed, beaten or shot

been killed by NADK soldiers [MilitaryReform: Monitor], whose names were given to the investigators. On
27 December a group of about 24 soldiers attacked Taches village in Kompong

asked villagers to identify ""Vietnamese"" residents and killed 14 people

October and November in which the victims were of Vietnamese origin. Three of
these, involving kidnapping, murder and the destruction of property, took
place in Sihanoukville. The fourth concerned the abduction, rape and murder
of Vietnamese nationals, apparently by a group of Cambodian men, early in
November. On 17 November 1992, on the basis of a Civilian Police and Human

KPNLF). The worst incidents have taken place in Battambang, Kandal,
Sihanoukville, Pursat, Prey Veng, Svay Rieng, Koh Kong, Siem Reap and Kampot.
In most cases, unknown assailants driving past the offices or homes of party

neutral political environment conducive to the holding of free and fair
elections, as called for in article 6 of the Paris Agreement. This
environment is to be achieved through UNTAC control of the existing
administrative structures, as well as by promoting respect for human rights as
provided for in article 16 of the Paris Agreement. As my Special
Representative has informed the Supreme National Council, such an environment
does not yet exist. A spate of violent incidents over the last few months has
heightened a sense of insecurity among Cambodians. UNTAC's Human Rights,

closed in December 1992, will ensure that UNTAC broadcasts can be heard
throughout the country. These efforts are complemented by the dissemination
in the provinces of 43,000 radios donated by the Japanese people through a
non-governmental organization and by a Japanese political party. Another

review of existing logging contracts concluded with the four Cambodian
parties, the development of legal penalties for illegal trade in logs and sawn
timber and provisions for UNTAC supervision of the enforcement of the
moratorium by the border police and customs authorities of the existing
administrative structures. Since 1 January 1993, in accordance with that plan

decided to extend its control to the ""council of ministers"" of the Phnom Penh
administration, since a number of decisions affecting the activities of other
""ministries"" are taken at that level. On the other hand, UNTAC has been
unable to gain access to the administrative structure of POK, and this
inability has given rise to a hardening of the position of the Phnom Penh

enter POK-controlled zones without prior authorization and that UNTAC must
assume full responsibility for incidents that occurred as a result of its
failure to obtain such authorization [HostilityGovernment: Verbal]. On 22 December 1992, my Special

Military Component, which was based on the requirements of regroupment and
cantonment, has been realigned to correspond with the borders of the Cambodian
provinces. This will conform with the deployment of electoral teams and
shorten the time taken to respond to potential threats to them. The new
deployment, which was completed on 31 December 1992, is also designed to
foster a sense of security among Cambodians in those areas with a higher
potential for conflict. Similarly, military observers now accompany electoral
teams in order to negotiate, where necessary, with local authorities or forces
that try to hinder registration [ElectionAssistance: Implement]. While some incidents have occurred, as
described below, the military observers have often succeeded in such

that the armed forces of SOC (CPAF) are attempting to recover territory over
which NADK extended its influence during the recent rains, while NADK is

proposed revisions of the Electoral Law with the parties concerned [LegalReform, ElectionAssistance: Meeting]. On the
basis of his reports, I have given careful consideration to these two issues,
especially in view of the support expressed for them by Prince Sihanouk.
However, I have regretfully come to the conclusion that the extension of the
franchise on purely ethnic grounds to persons who were not born in Cambodia
would not be consistent with the letter or the spirit of the Paris
Agreements. Furthermore, at a time when the registration process is nearing
completion, the printing of additional registration cards and other necessary
documentation would create such delays that it would make it practically
impossible to hold the elections in May 1993, in accordance with the
time-table set by the Security Council. The same can be said of the complex
problems arising from any attempt to allow Cambodians to register overseas. I
have therefore told my Special Representative that, unless the Security
Council decides otherwise, he should not approve these two proposed revisions
of the Electoral Law.";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;Meeting;;;;;;;;;;;;;Meeting

parties to submit a list containing the names, signatures, voter registration
numbers and addresses of at least 5,000 registered voters who are members of
the party. On 30 November 1992, Mr. Khieu Samphan, Mr. Son Sen and other
members of POK announced that they had established the founding committee of a
new party, the National Unity of Cambodia Party (NUCP). In a statement issued
the same day, my Special Representative indicated that such a party should
register under the Electoral Law and participate fully in the electoral
process by, inter alia, granting access to other parties and to UNTAC, so that
it can discharge its functions in accordance with the Paris Agreements [PartyAssistance: Advocate].

present have been permitted to register applicants and have reported high
levels of interest in and commitment to the electoral process among the
population of those zones. In some cases, residents have been permitted to
leave the zones to register at registration points located outside them. In
other cases, however, NADK units have refused to allow teams to carry out
registration and have requested them to leave [HostilityGovernment: Physical]. The teams complied, but they
will keep trying wherever possible until the completion of the registration
process at the end of January. Since UNTAC has not been allowed access to all
the POK-controlled areas, it is unable to estimate the size of the population
of those areas or the number of potential voters living there who have not
been registered. However, the POK-controlled areas are generally considered
to be sparsely populated, comprising only about 5 per cent of the total
population.";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
UNTAC_S/25124;28;1956;"28. In view of the unwillingness of PDK to guarantee access to zones under
its control [HostilityGovernment: Physical], UNTAC has adopted the practice of registering all applicants in
non-PDK areas before moving gradually into districts in which NADK is known to
operate. Electoral teams in these districts carry out their tasks in close
cooperation with the Civilian Police and Military Components, whose functions,
as described below, have been modified to enable them to protect electoral

leading to the holding of free and fair elections no later than May 1993, must
be maintained. But it is necessary to spell out what this will entail if - as
I still hope will not be the case - POK maintains its non-cooperation with
UNTAC. The election will take place while a substantial part of the forces of
the Cambodian parties remains under arms. Few of these troops will have been
cantoned and the Paris Agreements' requirement that at least 70 per cent of
them should have been demobilized will not have been met. This does not by
itself mean that a free and fair election cannot be held., but it will add to
UNTAC's difficulties both in organizing the election and in ensuring, as best
it can, the security of candidates, voters and electoral officials throughout
the electoral process. It also has to be observed that if UNTAC continues to
be denied access to POK-controlled areas [HostilityGov: Physical], the people living in those areas are
likely to be deprived of the opportunity to exercise their right to register
and to vote.";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Security Council supported the intention of the Secretary-General concerning
the check-points in the country and along its borders with neighbouring
countries, UNTAC has drawn up plans to strengthen border controls [BorderControl: Implement]. The·
effective implementation of these plans, however, will require the close
cooperation of neighbouring countries, as called for in paragraph 4 of

UNTAC_S/24800;19;1938;"19. The issue of foreign residents and immigrants is a matter which deeply
concerns many Cambodians. The recent killings of Vietnamese-speaking
villagers and fishermen in Tuk Meas village and in Koh Kong province have
aroused serious concern about public security as well as about their
implications for the creation of a neutral political environment. UNTAC
investigations indicate that units of NADK were responsible for both
incidents [MilitaryReform: Monitor]. While the issue of foreign residents is a matter for discussion
between the future government of Cambodia and the Governments of neighbouring
countries, UNTAC is considering the establishment of a Technical Advisory
Committee to the Supreme National Council to gather factual information as a
basis for s~ch discussion.";;;;;;;;;;;Monitor;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
UNTAC_S/24800;18;1937;"18. UNTAC has devoted and will continue to devote serious attention to the
question of foreign forces. The Strategic Investigation Team established
under annex II, article X of the Agreements will shortly submit to a special
session of the Supreme National Council an interim report on its
investigations of allegations or suspicions of the presence of foreign forces
in Cambodia. To date, UNTAC has not found evidence of the presence of any
formed units of such forces in areas to which it has access [Demilitarization: Monitor]. In this context,
I wish to call on all pa=ties to facilitate, in accordance with paragraph 7 of
resolution 783 (1992), UNTAC investigations of reports of forei~n forces,
foreign military assistance and cease-fire violations within the territory
under their control.";;;;Monitor;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

phase II of the cease-fire, some 55,000 troops of the three participating
factions, or approximately a quarter of the estimated total number of troops,
have entered the cantonment sites and handed over their weapons [DisarmamentDemobilization: Implement]. Some 40,000
of them were subsequently released, subject to recall by UNTAC, on
agricultural leave. PDK has, however, refused to participate and ordered its
troops not to canton, although some 200 personnel of the National Army of
Democratic Kamp,chea (NADK) have spontaneously presented themselves to UNTAC.
Under the circumst3nces, it has not been possible to continue the cantonment
process towards its conclusion.";Implement;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

11 civilian.Police Monitors. There were no casualties, and the nearby UNTAC
check-point was subsequently reinforced by the Military Component. These
attacks took place in areas where PDK is known to be present. That party is
also believed to be responsible for the destruction of two bridges, on
routes 6 and 21, on 13 October.

Samrong suffered a loss in hydraulic pressure as a result of small-arms fire
above the village of Phum Damari Slap and was forced to land. Another

country. After a period of relative quiet in the rainy season, tension has
again increased in the central and northern parts of Cambodia following a
series of artillery exchanges. These are generally of an indecisive character
with few casualties on either side, and no overall pattern is evident. In the
opinion of UNTAC the responsibility for these cease-fire violations is divided
between the two largest factions, PDK and SOC. I sincerely hope, however,
that these violations do not constitute a prelude to the resumption of
dry-season military activity by any of the parties. My Special Representative
recently issued a call for military restraint [MilitaryReform: Advocate]. I too appeal to all parties to
respect the cease-fire scrupulously and to refrain, in accordance with
article 9 of the Paris Agreements, from any activity which is aimed at
enlarging the territory they control or which might lead to renewed fighting.";;;;;;;;;;;Advocate;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

about a million Cambodians, or almost a quarter of the estimated 4.5 million
qualified to do so, have now been duly registered. The initiation of the
registration process in each province has been staggered as follows: Kandal,
Svay Rieng, Prey Veng and Kampong Cham on 19 October., Kampong Speu, Kampong

Mondulkiri, Ratanakiri, Stung Treng, Koh Kong, Kampong Thom, Battambang and
Siem Reap on 9 November. The process will be launched in the remaining two
provinces, Banteay Meanchey and Preah Vihear, on 23 November 1992.
Registration has so far proceeded successfully. The UNTAC-trained Cambodian
registration teams, working under international supervision, are hard-working

commitment to the process [ElectionAssistance: Implement].";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;Implement;;;;;;;;;;;;;
UNTAC_S/24578;65;1928;"65. UNTAC has made substantial strides towards its goals in the six months
since its inception despite constraints imposed by the refusal of PDK to
participate fully in the peace process, in particular the second phase of the
cease-fire. Following the adoption of the electoral law, provisional
registration of parties has begun and registration of voters is about to
begin [PartyAssistance: Implement]. Extensive military deployment across most of the country and a strong
police presence extending to the village level have been established. More
than 115,000 refugees and displaced persons have been safely repatriated [RefugeeAssistance: Implement]. The
international community has pledged $880 million to meet the essential
rehabilitation needs of the country. Supervision and control over the
existing administrative structures of three of the parties have been
established and are being strengthened [StateAdministration: Assist, Implement]. UNTAC continues to inform Cambodians
of their human rights and to foster the protection of those rights [HumanRights: Outreach, Implement]. All
UNTAC.'s activities are becoming increasingly familiar to Cambodians throughout
the country as a result of the information and public awareness' campaign.
UNTAC has thus acquired a powerful momentum that has enabled it to move ahead
simultaneously on many fronts. Its presence has already had a profound and
probably lasting impact on Cambodia. These achievements would not have been
possible without the continuing support of the Security Council and the
international community, the full cooperation of His Royal Highness Prince

proposal for discussion, the Supreme National Council decided on 23 July to
set up another Technical Advisory Committee, also under the chairmanship of
UNTAC's Director of Rehabilitation, to formulate and recommend to the Supreme
National Council specific measures for dealing with the issue. The Technical

problem of the overexploitation of Cambodia's natural resources. At its 7 May
meeting, the Deputy Special Representative had pointed out that the rapid
depletion of the country's timber stock and gem mines could not only have
grave environmental consequences but could also affect the vital interests and
the future of Cambodia in other ways. He invited the Supreme National Council

list of 10 programmes totalling more than $187 million [StateAdministration, Gender, EconomicDevelopment: Meeting]. The largest of these
were the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) programme of cooperation
($89 million), a three-year programme funded and executed by UNICEF and aimed
at improving drinking water supply and sanitation, schools, health services
and food security, as well as support for disadvantaged women and assistance
to handicapped and disadvantaged children. The second major programme
proposed was an aide-memoire for an Asian Development Bank (AsDB) soft loan
for $74.4 million covering projects in transport, power, agriculture and
education. The four Cambodian parties supported 9 of the 10 proposed
programmes, but POK opposed borrowing from an international financial
institution until such time as the issue of the role and powers of the Supreme

throughout the country supports the military component in ""showing the flag""
and assuring Cambodians of UNTAC's commitment to the peace process. The
police presence, like that of the military, promotes the creation of a neutral
political environment by making Cambodians aware that arbitrary abuse of power
will not be tolerated. It was UNTAC civilian police officers, for example,
who played a leading role in securing the release of Mr. Ieng Mouly, a KPNLF
member of the Supreme National Council, when he was arrested in July by the

in my second special report, PDK has introduced its own interpretations of the
provisions of the Paris Agreements relating to the verification of the
withdrawal and non-return of foreign forces and to the role and powers of the
Supreme National Council (see S/23177, annex). PDK asserts that these
provisions have not been implemented and that, until they are, it is not in a
position to proceed with ths implementation of the other provisions. In line
with this assertion, PDK has issued a series of proposals laying down
conditions under which it would be prepared to participate fully in the peace
process. Although my Special RPpresentative has carefully studied all these proposals with a view to identiiying ways of accommodating PDK's concerns, it
has not been possible to accept them because they are inconsistent with the

In line with the strategic development plan for the national police, 2017–2021, MINUJUSTH and UNDP, through the joint rule of law programme, continued to strengthen the capacity of the prison administration to autonomously manage its financial and administrative resources [PrisonReform: Assist with IA]. A total of 529 staff, including 164 women, has received relevant training. Draft penitentiary legislation, including the organic law elevating the prison administration to a central directorate within the national police, with autonomy over its own resources, was validated by the Director General of the national police during the reporting period and must now be tabled before Parliament through the Ministry of Justice and Public Security.

Delays continued in the installation of the National Council on Legal Aid, the body tasked with providing legal assistance to the most vulnerable, following the promulgation of the Legal Aid law on 26 October 2018. The State has yet to define its national legal assistance strategy, draft a related action plan and allocate funding to implement it. MINUJUSTH and UNDP supported the Ministry of Justice and Public Security through the recruitment of a consultant to draft the strategic plan, which will provide the National Council with the tools to establish 18 legal aid offices nationwide [JusticeSectorReform: AssistOther with IA]. With the support of UNDP, the Mission also facilitated the recruitment of a consultant to help the Superior Council of the Judiciary draft an annual report on its activities and the overall functioning of the judiciary, the third such report since the establishment of the Council in 2012 [JusticeSectorReform: AssistOther with IA].;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

In spite of the negative impact that the security situation has had on the functioning of the Port-au-Prince court of first instance, significant progress was made in reducing the rate of prolonged pretrial detention in the jurisdiction, in large part as a result of stronger leadership and more effective collaboration among judicial actors, through the penal chain committee, in handling penal cases. During the month of July, all 76 cases transferred to the Court were processed in real time by the prosecutor’s office, investigating judges closed 79 cases, and the Court held 29 judgment sessions, closing 23 cases. During the reporting period, the legal aid offices supported by MINUJUSTH contributed to the release of 34 adults and 18 minors [JusticeSectorReform: Implement].

The results of the second evaluation of the strategic development plan for the national police, 2017–2021, conducted with support from MINUJUSTH, showed continued progress [PoliceReform: Monitor]. Such progress notwithstanding, the persistent political crisis, the lack of government engagement and donor fatigue contributed to an overall low implementation rate of 34.5 per cent.

Since the adoption of the strategic development plan for the national police, 2017–2021, three promotions, comprising 2,370 cadets, including 453 women, have been incorporated into the force, most recently on 8 August, when the thirtieth promotion graduated. These recruits have raised the number of police officers to 15,404 nationwide, 10.5 per cent of whom are women. In addition, 67 national police officers were promoted to the rank of Police Commissioner on 1 August after having successfully completed a seven-month training course. While the national police appears on track to reach the target of 18,000 officers by December 2021, it will need to redouble efforts to achieve the objectives of 1.51 officer per 1,000 inhabitants (currently 1.33) and 12 per cent of women, as set out in its five-year plan.;;;;;;;;AssistOther,Assist;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

The General Inspectorate of the national police, with support from MINUJUSTH, is in the process of standardizing its criteria as part of the process to improve accountability for human rights violations committed by the national police [PoliceReform: AssistPolicies, HumanRights: Assist]. Between 1 July and 30 September, the General Inspectorate conducted administrative investigations of 93 per cent of the allegations of human rights violations received. During the reporting period, MINUJUSTH monitored 15 incidents of human rights violations allegedly committed by the national police, which resulted in 51 casualties [PoliceReform, HumanRights: Monitor]. Most incidents pertained to allegations of excessive use of force and ill-treatment of detainees following arrest. The Inspectorate has opened administrative investigations into 14 of these incidents. While in most cases no judicial proceedings were initiated, in four incidents the officers allegedly responsible were arrested and face prosecution. This reflects an improvement in relation to the previous reporting period, in which only one incident proceeded to the prosecution stage but will still require the sustained commitment of relevant authorities to ensure that 100 per cent of confirmed crimes or human rights violations committed by national police and Directorate of Prison Administration officers prosecuted. The Mission will continue to advocate for full and transparent accountability for these incidents [JusticeSectorReform: Advocate].;;;;;;;Monitor,Assist;;;Monitor,Assist,AssistPolicies;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

The occupancy rate stood at 364 per cent, based on the national standard of 2.5 square metres per detainee. The international standard is 4.5 square metres. Extreme overcrowding and poor hygiene conditions in most facilities have contributed to health problems among detainees, such as skin diseases, tuberculosis, diarrhoea and urinary tract infections. The death rate among detainees has increased from 8 per 1,000, as noted in my most recent report to 11.8 per 1,000 on a projected yearly basis, as at 15 October. The three leading causes of death among detainees are tuberculosis, malnutrition and cardiovascular diseases. The increase in the death rate is mostly due to irregular food deliveries and a shortage of medical staff and medication. Regular payment of suppliers has remained a challenge over the past years. Increased financial and administrative autonomy for the Prison Administration could help to prevent those recurring challenges. The Prison Administration, with support from MINUJUSTH, is implementing the medical road map and the emergency health directives, developing stronger partnerships with the Ministry of Public Health and Population, the World Health Organization and the non-governmental organization Health through Walls [PrisonReform, PublicHealth: Assist with IA].;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;InternationalActor,Assist;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;InternationalActor,Assist;;;

Mobile teams are currently facilitating the identification, implementation, monitoring, and evaluation of community violence reduction projects and quick-impact projects in order to address some of the shortcomings identified during their visits. While the latter will aim to improve infrastructure and provide equipment for police, court and prison facilities, the community violence reduction projects will address the nexus between the rule of law, human rights, justice and corrections, and foster greater coordination among local authorities, communities, other national and international actors and the media, including through public outreach and community mediation. Two community violence reduction projects for the establishment of legal aid offices in support of prison inmates were launched in Port-au-Prince [JusticeSectorReform, PrisonReform: Implement]. In parallel, support for marginalized communities will be strengthened from the bottom up, through the implementation of labour-intensive projects to improve access to public services, reinsertion activities for male and female detainees and the creation of income-generating activities to address the root causes of crime.

Efforts have also been made to advance crucial legislative reforms, in particular regarding a criminal code, a code of criminal procedure and a penitentiary law, all awaiting adoption by Parliament. Regarding the independence of the judiciary, three laws adopted in 2007 have played a key role in the administration and regulation of the justice system, leading to the opening of the School of Magistrates and the first, and still only, juvenile tribunal outside the capital, both in 2009, and to the establishment of the Superior Council of the Judiciary in 2012, which will require continuing substantial support to allow it to fully play its role as the guardian of an independent and impartial judicial system.;;;;;;;Implement;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Nevertheless, the fact that there were 105 deaths must still be deplored. On 10 August, the Prime Minister of Haiti, Jack Guy Lafontant, and my Special Representative for Haiti co chaired the eighth meeting of the High level Committee for the Elimination of Cholera [PublicHealth: Assist]. The Prime Minister reconfirmed the 10 year national plan for the elimination of cholera as the basis of the new Government’s policy approach, as well as the renewed engagement of the Government with the United Nations and other international partners to that end. The Government and its partners also agreed to an assessment of the implementation of the medium term plan for 2016 2018, with a view to prioritizing short and medium term interventions and formulating a realistic funding strategy. The United Nations Special Envoy for Haiti is spearheading efforts to secure the funds necessary to implement both the national plan and the new United Nations approach to cholera in Haiti, which will be critical to sustaining progress in ending the transmission of the disease.

Haitian civil society organizations, international partners and MINUSTAH highlighted human rights concerns with respect to draft laws on good moral conduct and on marriage, adopted by the Senate on 30 June and 1 August, the provisions of which appeared to target lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex people and other minority communities [Gender, LegalReform: Advocate with IA]. The Government has yet to assign the human rights portfolio to a specific ministry or to appoint a new national Ombudsperson for human rights, a position for which Parliament has shortlisted three candidates.

A United Nations electoral needs assessment mission, deployed to Haiti from 29 May to 2 June, provided recommendations on the holding of elections and proposed possible future United Nations support in that regard. The needs assessment mission observed that it was essential that United Nations electoral assistance be continued, in a manner aligned with the current transition context, in order to sustain and build on the results of the more than 13 years of such support provided in Haiti by MINUSTAH [ElectionAssistance: Assist]. The mission recommended that MINUJUSTH continue to support electoral institutional reform within its rule of law and good offices mandate, aimed at the establishment of the Permanent Electoral Council and the completion of the electoral legal framework [ElectionAssistance, LegalReform: Assist].

As part of MINUSTAH’s phased transition process, on 8 November, my Special Representative and the UNDP Country Director launched the United Nations joint interim rule of law programme involving MINUSTAH, UNDP, the United Nations Children’s Fund and the United Nations Entity for Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women (UN Women), providing integrated support to the justice and human rights system [JusticeSectorReform: AssistOther with IA, HumanRights: Assist with IA]. As at 27 February, 91 per cent of the first tranche, representing 50 per cent of the $4.435 million fund, had been spent or committed. To date, through the joint programme, the United Nations has, among other things, supported the Ombudsperson and the Directorate of Prisons Administration in reviewing the draft penitentiary law, with a view to improving prison management tools., recruited national consultants to assist in the review and implementation of the draft criminal procedural code and the draft criminal code., and assisted the Superior Court of Auditors and Administrative Disputes in refining its internal management structure to properly exercise its oversight function and dispute resolution and take steps toward the implementation of its strategic and operational plans during the period 2016 2024 [DemocraticInstitutions, PrisonReform: Assist with IA, LegalReform: Assist with IA].;;;;;;;Assist,InternationalActor;;;;;;;;;InternationalActor,Assist;;;;;;InternationalActor,Assist;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;InternationalActor,Assist

Over the past 12 months, legal aid offices in Les Cayes and Cap Haïtien processed 1,155 cases, including 52 women, resulting in 431 releases and 651 cases closed, including 30 and 35 women, respectively. The pretrial detention rate in Cap Haïtien consequently decreased from 55 to 41 per cent. In Port au Prince, the five legal aid offices processed 6,232 cases, resulting in the release of 3,181 people and the closure of 943 cases. MINUSTAH focused on the Port au Prince jurisdiction to establish real
time file management of cases, facilitating the processing of 464 files, which ultimately helped to increase the number of criminal hearings during the reporting period by more than 50 per cent [JusticeSectorReform: AssistOther]. My Special Representative has repeatedly urged the Government to more systematically address the problem of prolonged or illegal pretrial detention, requiring strong local ownership and the prioritization of judicial reform [JusticeSectorReform, PrisonReform: Advocate].

This represented a substantial increase of $44.2 million, or 26.2 per cent, compared to the $168.7 million of the 2014/15 budget. The increase was necessary mainly to cover the salaries of newly graduated officers. A total of 77 per cent of the Haitian National Police’s operating budget is designated for personnel costs. MINUSTAH assisted the police in securing donor support for the development of key policing areas, as the current budget allocation remains insufficient [PoliceReform: AssistOther (Should it be MaterialSupport?)].

His conclusion was that, in the current context of political uncertainty and a relatively stable but fragile security situation, the continued presence of MINUSTAH is required until the completion of the electoral process to support the national authorities in the effective organization of the elections and the maintenance of a safe and secure environment. The capacity of the Haitian National Police has continued to improve, and they have demonstrated their determination to provide for the safety and security of the Haitian people. However, they are not yet operationally independent and continue to rely on international support, including from MINUSTAH, in fulfilling their constitutional mandate [PoliceReform: AssistOther].

During the reporting period, crowd control units managed demonstrations with minimal support from MINUSTAH [Operations_PatrolsInterventions: Assist, PoliceReform: AssistOther]. The police also made significant progress through enhanced training in areas such as the judicial police, counter narcotics and anti kidnapping. In other areas, however, such as human rights awareness, police oversight, strategic planning and maintenance of facilities and equipment, international support is still required. The police also continued to rely on the support of MINUSTAH in addressing criminality and street gang violence [PoliceReform: AssistOther]. In this respect, the police still lack an effective criminal intelligence bureau with the capacity to produce reliable information, and criminal investigation resources to prevent and solve serious crimes and to combat organized criminal networks. Despite progress in the implementation of community policing initiatives in the Port au Prince metropolitan area, the national police lack coordinated and comprehensive community based programmes countrywide.

Effective prison management would require more than the current 1,681 national corrections personnel in service. Severe overcrowding (445 per cent occupancy rate), 23 hours of daily confinement, food shortages, poor hygiene and sanitation conditions and insufficient medical services continue to cause severe problems and are a major human rights concern. In my previous report, I indicated that only 3 of the 17 detention facilities under the jurisdiction of the Directorate of Prison Administration, holding 1,402 detainees, provided slightly more than one square metre per detainee. This has now dropped to only one detention centre, for 89 people. At the national penitentiary, conditions continue to be the most dramatic, with three detainees per square metre. Prison statistics do not include the large number of detainees held in unofficial detention centres such as police stations. Despite repeated calls by the United Nations system, the Government has not taken comprehensive steps to address the problem. Furthermore, between February and August, changes of food suppliers and repeated delays in disbursing funds caused acute food shortages in prisons, resulting in reductions in meals.

institutions such as the police, justice and corrections systems [PoliceReform, JusticeSectorReform, PrisonReform: Monitor]. Following a national
workshop on the results of the first round of data collection, the Ministry of Justice
and Public Security incorporated most of the recommendations on rule-of-law
reform into the Ministry action plan for the period 2013-2016. While the plan
provides a vision for the development of justice in the country, there remains a need
for a broader national justice development plan. Meanwhile, the Global Focal Point
team on police, justice and corrections from United Nations Headquarters visited
Haiti in April 2013 and, together with MINUSTAH and several United Nations
agencies, funds and programmes, developed a country support plan for Haiti [PoliceReform, JusticeSectorReform: AssistPolicies with IA, PrisonReform: Assist with IA (not sure whether the government was involved in the process or the plan was developed solely by the international actors)]. The
Mission has also provided inputs to the United Nations Development Programme
(UNDP) project on the rule of law (2013-2016) and continues to contribute towards
joint implementation of the project, where required. In a related development, the
United Nations Rule of Law Working Group coordination mechanism was launched

increased responsibility for the provision of internal security, particularly in the four
departments vacated by the MINUSTAH military component (Grand-Anse, Nippes,
North-West and South). Nevertheless, MINUSTAH continued to play an important
role in maintaining overall security and stability, particularly when robust action
was needed to intervene in sensitive areas and in cases of violent civil unrest [Operations_UseofForce: Implement]. In
concert with the Haitian National Police, the Mission maintained its military and
police presence in violence-prone areas and in some camps for internally displaced
persons [Operations_PatrolsInterventions: Assist, RefugeeAssistance: Assist, ProvideSecurity]. From March to June 2013, the military and police components carried out
7,444 joint patrols with the Haitian National Police in Port-au-Prince and its

steady downward trend in homicides, with a monthly average of 61 homicides from
March to June 2013, down from 90 in the same period in 2012. This improvement
resulted in part from the frequent successful joint operations conducted by the
Haitian National Police and MINUSTAH in the sensitive areas of Port-au-Prince,
where approximately 83 per cent of all cases occurred during the reporting period,
managing to curb the spike in gang violence witnessed previously [Operations_PatrolsInterentions: Assist]. There was also a
decrease in the number of kidnappings with a monthly average of nine cases. This is
roughly 50 per cent below the monthly average during the previous reporting period

stakeholders. On 28 May, the Senate unanimously adopted a non-binding resolution
calling for the progressive and orderly withdrawal of MINUSTAH by May 2014 [HostilityGov: Verbal (unsure whether this amounts to coding Hostility. Same as the previous sentence for coding HostilityOther: Verbal)]. A
similar resolution had already been adopted by the Senate in 2011. My Special
Representative met on several occasions with President Martelly and Prime Minister
Lamothe to explain the ongoing reduction of the MINUSTAH footprint and the
Mission consolidation plan. Both leaders expressed support for a phased withdrawal
of the Mission as the capacity of national institutions increased. A joint

efforts continued through international and national media relations and regular
press conferences, in addition to timely issuance of press releases and other products,
including the Mission’s radio, website, live streaming, social media and television
productions. The Mission also used its media products for outreach on cholera
prevention, disaster and hurricane season preparedness and its work to strengthen
the national police and rule of law institutions [PublicHealth, HumanitarianRelief, PoliceReform: Outreach]. In parallel with those outreach

Ministry for the Status of Women and Women’s Rights to render operational the
special spaces for the reception of victims of sexual and gender-based violence
established in three camps for internally displaced persons [SexualViolence, RefugeeAssistance: Assistance]. The spaces are designed
to promote the reporting of sexual violence cases and facilitate medical,

justice, gender and child protection components, ensuring that human rights
standards and principles are integrated into the Mission’s approach to sexual and
gender-based violence [SexualViolence, HumanRights: Implement]. During the reporting period, the gender focal points of the
MINUSTAH police component and the national police initiated actions to raise
awareness among potential victims of sexual violence of available services and the
importance of submitting their complaints to the justice system [SexualViolence: Outreach, Assist]. In addition, the
Mission delivered its sexual and gender-based violence training-of-trainers course to
52 instructors of the national police in September and October 2012 [PoliceReform: AssistAgents, SexualViolence: Assist].

the recommendations made by the Working Group on the Universal Periodic Review.
On 30 November, 21 years after ratifying the International Covenant on Civil and
Political Rights, Haiti submitted its very first report to the Human Rights Committee,
which is responsible for monitoring the implementation of the Covenant. Some
progress in building capacity and the ratification of international human rights
instruments notwithstanding, key challenges and systemic deficiencies remain, in

MINUSTAH_S/2013/139;37;1386;"37. MINUSTAH has noted that the collection of evidence for prosecution is
generally unsatisfactory, hampering the ability of the judicial authorities to
investigate violent acts and prosecute criminals. An unusually high number of cases
rely primarily or exclusively on confessions. To improve the quality of evidence
available for prosecution, MINUSTAH has funded the reconstruction of the
Forensics Institute [JusticeSectorReform: MaterialSupport]. This will make it possible to conduct autopsies and eventually
also include examinations of victims of non-homicidal crimes. Nevertheless, the
Ministry of Public Health and Population and the Ministry of Justice and Public
Security have not yet been able to render the Institute operational. An additional
concern is the prosecution of certain high-profile criminals, which has been subject
to political interference. A case in point is that of Calixte Valentin, a policy adviser
to the President who, although accused of murder, was conditionally released from
pretrial detention. Such release, which is provided for in the Criminal Procedure
Code, is very rarely applied and does not benefit the vast majority of detainees,
suggesting that he was granted undue favour.";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
MINUSTAH_S/2013/139;36;1385;"36. The proper functioning of the Superior Council takes on added importance in
the context of a number of recent appointments of justices of the peace by the
Ministry of Justice and Public Security. In many cases, appointees appear to lack the
required legal qualifications and experience. Given that such appointments could
undermine the legitimacy and independence of the judiciary, and have already
negatively affected the functioning of courts in several departments, the Superior
Council’s eventual review of these cases is of critical importance. MINUSTAH has
offered technical assistance to the Superior Council in handling complaints in this
regard [JusticeSectorReform: AssistOther]. It has also assisted the Superior Council in collecting documentation to
verify the qualifications of more than 500 justices of the peace so as not to preclude
their possible reappointment at the end of their current term [JusticeSectorReform: AssistOther, Monitor].";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
MINUSTAH_S/2013/139;35;1384;"35. For several months following its establishment in July 2012, the Superior
Council of the Judiciary was unable to focus on its mandated oversight of the
judiciary because it was embroiled in controversy over the initial and procedurally
flawed vote on the designation of its Electoral Council members. Those obstacles
notwithstanding, MINUSTAH supported the Superior Council in the preparation of

Public Security unexpectedly replaced the Inspector General, Abner Vilmé, after
nine months in service. Before his dismissal, he had successfully conducted several
inquiries into allegations of human rights violations by police officers and had
recommended the dismissal of several officers. The Director General of the national
police and the Minister of Justice and Public Security have to date failed to act upon
his recommendations, however. That the Inspector General remains under the
authority of the Director General and has been replaced three times over the past
12 months raises questions about the independence and effectiveness of the oversight
body. Furthermore, the Inspectorate General struggles with insufficient personnel,
compounded by a shortage of equipment, specialized training and financial
resources. The newly appointed Inspector General has, however, pledged to build an

the current 10,181 to a minimum of 15,000 by 2016, the national police will have to
significantly increase its intake of recruits. With the graduation of only 239 new
cadets on 21 December, the twenty-third national police promotion fell far short of
the minimum of 1,000 cadets required per promotion. This appears to have been due
in part to the rigorousness of medical tests and the short duration and limited
geographic coverage of recruitment campaigns. The national police is working
closely with MINUSTAH to tackle these issues and ensure that the twenty-fourth
promotion, scheduled to begin by March 2013, comprises at least 1,000 cadets [PoliceReform: AssistOther].

as a strategic tool to support the implementation of its mandate. Public information
efforts continued through international and national media relations and regular
press conferences, in addition to timely issuance of press releases and other
products, including through the Mission’s radio, website, social media and
television productions. Radio MINUSTAH FM continued providing support to
efforts to prevent cholera, ensure disaster and hurricane preparedness, and promote
national reconciliation and the rule of law [StateAdministration, NationalReconciliation, PublicHealth: Outreach]. In close coordination with other
MINUSTAH components and United Nations agencies, the Mission produced its
weekly 15-minute video programme on topics of interest to the Haitian public
concerning its work and current affairs, which is broadcast on seven national

children’s rights, including 128 cases of rape, 6 cases of kidnapping, 5 cases of child
trafficking, 7 cases of homicide and 3 cases in which children were shot and injured,
frequently during shoot-outs between rival gangs. The reports are shared weekly
with the national police Brigade for the Protection of Minors for follow-up.
Concerning child trafficking, MINUSTAH briefed civilian agents of the Brigade and
local communities against smuggling and trafficking of children at border posts with
the Dominican Republic and established a hotline hosted by the Brigade to report
child trafficking and other offences against children [ChildRights: Implement, Outreach, PoliceReform: AssistAgents, BorderControl: Outreach]. After sustained advocacy by

Women’s Rights in running safe spaces for survivors of sexual and gender-based
violence established in three camps for internally displaced persons, in addition to
coordinating the creation of similar spaces in seven national police stations [SexualViolence, RefugeeAssistance: Assist, PoliceReform: AssistOther]. The

organized 28 training sessions for national police officers on police response to
sexual and gender-based violence, in addition to 27 training sessions for Haitian
legal professionals on legal recourse for victims of sexual violence [SexualViolence, JusticeSectorReform: Assist with IA, PoliceReform: AssistAgents with IA]. MINUSTAH
held a five-day training-of-trainers session for 30 community leaders (20 women

part of the reporting period constituted major obstacles to progress in the promotion
and protection of human rights. The Mission maintained its focus on the
investigation and reporting of human rights violations [HumanRights: Monitor]. In June 2012, it published a
report on the inadequate response by the criminal justice sector to rape complaints
filed in the Port-au-Prince metropolitan area and issued recommendations on how
victims of rape and other sexual crimes could better gain access to justice, which are
also informing the Mission’s engagement with the authorities [SexualViolence, JusticeSectorReform: Monitor, Advocate]. The limited efforts by
the police and judiciary to investigate the killings that were the subject of public
MINUSTAH reports in 2011 have not achieved significant results. Political will is
needed to advance efforts to combat impunity, in particular following the
controversial statement by the Haitian magistrate leading the investigation of former
President Jean-Claude Duvalier that the statute of limitations blocked prosecution of
the well-documented human rights crimes under the Duvalier regime. MINUSTAH
continues to conduct capacity-building and awareness-raising activities throughout
the country [HumanRights: Outreach, Implement]. It has established good working relations with the Minister with special
responsibility for promoting human rights and combating extreme poverty and has
also provided assistance to the Office of the Ombudsman to prepare a law consistent
with the Principles relating to the status of national institutions for the promotion

detention by reviewing pending cases, which led to the release of numerous
individuals, the growing number of new arrests has meant that the rate has remained
high. As part of its programme aimed at improving correctional practices,
MINUSTAH trained 105 Haitian corrections officers in the country’s 16 prisons [PrisonReform: Assist].
The mentoring and training provided to medical personnel notwithstanding, inmate
death rates increased significantly, primarily as a result of the resurgence of cholera
and tuberculosis. A total of 69 deaths from various causes were reported for the first
half of 2012, compared to an annual total of 43 in 2011. MINUSTAH is working
closely with health partners and the Prison Administration leadership to enhance
health services, although the absence of qualified staff remains a significant
challenge [PrisonReform, PublicHealth: Assist]. MINUSTAH corrections officers have also been embedded in the Office
of the Ombudsman and in the internal investigations branch of the national police,
so as to raise awareness and increase capacity for intervention within the prison
environment, in an effort to ensure that appropriate action is taken in cases of
negligence and serious human rights violations [PrisonReform, DemocraticInstitutions, HumanRights: Assist. PoliceReform: AssistOther]. Efforts continued to build the
capacity of the prison registration system, enabling the identification and release of
prisoners irregularly detained. Following the endorsement of standard operating
procedures for correctional facilities by the Haitian authorities, MINUSTAH is
working with the Prison Administration on their implementation [PrisonReform: Assist]. MINUSTAH

jurisdictions in Jacmel, Port-de-Paix and Fort-Liberté resulted in improved justice
service delivery and decreased the levels of pretrial detention. UNDP and
MINUSTAH jointly trained local magistrates, police officers and Prison
Administration agents in investigation techniques and judicial identification in
several regions [JusticeSectorReform, PoliceReform: AssistAgents with IA, PrisonReform: Assist with IA]. During the reporting period, MINUSTAH executed 17 quick-impact

75 per cent of municipalities completing the exercise during the reporting period [DemocraticInstitutions: Assist].
This activity, aimed at institutionalizing a culture of accountability, was hampered
by several factors, including political uncertainty caused by the replacement by
presidential decree of more than 60 per cent of the country’s 140 municipal councils
whose term in office had expired in 2011 and the weakness of the internal
management procedures of the Ministry of the Interior. The Mission and the
Ministry participated jointly in planning and supervising the preparation of

rights violations [HumanRights: Monitor]. Through the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for
Human Rights, in December 2011, MINUSTAH published two reports on alleged
illegal killings by Haitian National Police officers and regretted that, despite some
efforts by the police and judiciary to investigate the killings, there was a significant
lack of capacity of the State to effectively prosecute and punish perpetrators [HumanRights, PoliceReform, JusticeSectorReform: Monitor]. The
Mission also closely monitored the trial of police and prison officers who were
accused of illegal killings during the prison riot at Les Cayes on 19 January 2010 [PoliceReform, PrisonReform: Monitor].
The trial resulted in the conviction of eight defendants and the acquittal of six
others. On 30 January, the Haitian magistrate leading the investigation of former
President Jean-Claude Duvalier stated that the statute of limitations blocked
prosecution of the well-documented human rights crimes under the Duvalier regime
and that Mr. Duvalier should face trial only on corruption charges. MINUSTAH
publicly expressed regret over the decision. The Mission continued to advocate for
and support State action to ensure accountability for human rights violations
committed during the Duvalier regime [HumanRights: Advocate]. MINUSTAH also conducted a range of
training programmes for local authorities and community leaders to build rule-oflaw

security, staffing and training needs, policy development and infrastructure
improvements [PrisonReform: Assist, MaterialSupport]. The daily presence of MINUSTAH officers in all 16 of the country’s
prisons has allowed for improvements across these priority areas, in particular at the
local level. However, Haiti’s prisons continued to suffer from overcrowding,
deficient management, excessive pretrial detention and food and water shortages.
Improvements were noted with respect to the separation of minors in all but three
prisons and in overall sanitary conditions. One of the Mission’s top priorities has
been to support the office of the Director of the Prison Administration in developing
standardized procedures and practices for the operation of the new prison in Croix
des Bouquets [PrisonReform: Assist]. To date, 9 of the 12 proposed standard procedures have been
officially signed by the Director of the Prison Administration. The remaining three
directives will be presented to the Minister of Justice and the leadership of the
Haitian National Police for final validation. During the reporting period, particular
focus was directed towards the release of inmates in pretrial detention or those who
had exceeded their sentences. As a result of MINUSTAH efforts, 269 detainees were
liberated between September 2011 and January 2012 [PrisonReform: Assist. In addition, two MINUSTAH
quick-impact projects were completed and contributed to better working and living
conditions in two prisons in Les Cayes and Grande Rivière du Nord [PrisonReform: MaterialSupport]. Moreover,
MINUSTAH provided field officer training to 42 national correctional officers on
assessing the performance of new recruits in prisons [PrisonReform: Assist]. A further 14 correctional

partner, the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR), informed stakeholders,
including MINUSTAH, of its decision to end the financing of Haiti’s legal aid
programme. The Government of Haiti has indicated to MINUSTAH that it intends to
take over the management of the legal aid programme. In January 2012, the
Ministry of Justice and Public Security established a transitional working group,
with the participation of MINUSTAH and other stakeholders, to prepare a
development plan for a sustainable legal aid system and review the draft law
establishing the Système national d’assistance légale [JusticeSectorReform: Meeting, AssistPolicies, LegalReform: Meeting, Assist]. In conjunction with UNDP,

63 community violence reduction projects amounting to $9 million., 26 of those
projects focused on environmental conservation and provided 20,000 at-risk youth
with short-term employment. MINUSTAH also supported vocational training and
continues to provide job placement support to 1,110 at-risk youth in partnership
with the Haitian private sector and State institutions. MINUSTAH is providing

impoverished districts of Port-au-Prince, camps for the internally displaced and
remote areas of the country. In October 2011, MINUSTAH in collaboration with the
Haitian National Police and the Ministry of Women’s Affairs and Women’s Rights
established special reception areas for victims of sexual and gender-based violence
in three of the most at-risk camps in Port-au-Prince [SexualViolence, RefugeeAssistance: Assist, MaterialSupport]. Preparations are ongoing for
similar reception facilities in seven police stations in the metropolitan area. During
the reporting period, MINUSTAH also established a coordination and response
office on sexual and gender-based violence within the Haitian National Police [SexualViolence: MaaterialSupport, Assist, PoliceReform: MaterialSupport, AssistOther].
MINUSTAH and UNDP conducted related training for Haitian National Police

displaced persons and conducted daily rotational patrols in approximately 150
“non-permanent” camps [Operations_UseofForce, Operations_PatrolsInterventions: Assist, RefugeeAssistance: Assist, ProvideSecurity, Monitor]. In response to the forced evictions of displaced persons,
particularly in Léogâne, the epicentre of the 2010 earthquake, the protection cluster
engaged with the Haitian authorities to advocate for the adoption of a
comprehensive camp closure plan. The proposed plan would link camp closure dates
to the provision of alternative housing and the identification of sites for long-term
settlement. In Port-au-Prince, the Government made visible progress in
implementing its “16/6” resettlement programme, providing rental or home repair
subsidies to residents of six camps in prominent neighbourhoods of the city. This
initiative was coupled with the rehabilitation of the 16 neighbourhoods from which

allegations of corruption and fraud against three counsellors, including the President
of the Council, Gaillot Dorsainvil. While judicial proceedings against
Mr. Dorsainvil have begun, he has thus far refused to appear before the investigating
judge, claiming that the Constitution grants him immunity from the jurisdiction of
the court. The lack of a functioning electoral council during the reporting period has
limited the impact of the institutional support efforts of MINUSTAH. Work focused

to maintain a secure and stable environment and contribute to the restoration of
Haitian institutional capacity. The assessment conducted at the request of the
Security Council in its resolution 1944 (2010) found that the earthquake had not
resulted in a breakdown of law and order, nor had it altered the nature of the
security threats facing Haiti. With the winding down of large-scale humanitarian
operations and the completion of the elections, many of the additional challenges
that had justified the increase in the Mission’s authorized troop and police strength
have been met or have decreased significantly. In this regard, the protection of
internally displaced persons and the provision of engineering support for recovery
and reconstruction constitute the two primary new tasks taken on by the Mission
since the earthquake. The former task will continue to absorb a significant portion of
the Mission’s capabilities, albeit on a decreasing scale, until durable solutions such

together with OHCHR, investigated violations such as alleged extrajudicial killings,
arbitrary arrest, and detention and the ill treatment of detainees, and advocated
systematic responses to cases by the police and the judiciary [HumanRights, PrisonReform: Monitor, Advocate, PoliceReform, JusticeSectorReform: Advocate]. In parallel,
MINUSTAH worked with State authorities to advance efforts in response to

ensure sustainable change have lagged behind, and serious violations of human
rights and inhumane conditions of detention persist in Haiti’s prisons. As a result,
frequent intervention by MINUSTAH and other international partners and
non-governmental organizations in support of prisoners’ health, security and overall

performance assessment system to facilitate the monitoring of municipalities’
administrative and financial management, service delivery and local development
activities [StateAdministration: MaterialSupport]. The matrix allows MINUSTAH to make semi-annual assessments of

expressed interest in appropriating the tool for future use. From April to July,
MINUSTAH monitored the execution of the 2010/11 municipal budgets and assisted
the Ministry in updating the guidelines for the preparation of municipal budgets [StateAdministration: Monitor, Assist].
Those guidelines have been put into effect as part of the 2011/12 municipal budget
drafting process, which MINUSTAH and the Ministry jointly supervised between
July and August 2011 [StateAdministration: Monitor]. In an effort to increase ministerial institutional memory,
MINUSTAH assisted the Ministry in drawing up an inventory of ongoing projects

for 1,110 young people in Port-au-Prince, Gonaïves and Cap-Haïtien and has
supported the establishment of 34 women-led commercial enterprises in the poorest
areas of the capital [Gender: MaterialSupport]. Other activities have included the completion of training
facilities in support of the rehabilitation of inmates, and the construction of legal aid
centres and schools [PrisonReform: MaterialSupport]. MINUSTAH has partnered with two Haitian non-governmental
organizations to provide grass-roots support to victims of sexual and gender-based
violence and to reduce drug- and alcohol-related violence [SexualViolence, CivilSocietyAssistance: Implement]. The Mission is also

Haitian National Police and the judiciary severely limited State response. As a
preventive measure, MINUSTAH repeatedly revised the patrolling of its police and
military personnel to cover areas where sexual and gender-based violence appeared
to be most prevalent [Operations_PatrolsInterventions, SexualViolence: Assist]. In addition, United Nations police launched a project aimed at

localized violent episodes of unrest. In November 2010, violent public
demonstrations in the North and Centre Departments took place and were due, in
part, to the perception that MINUSTAH might have been responsible for the
outbreak of cholera. During these demonstrations, armed groups damaged or
destroyed United Nations vehicles and premises in Cap-Haïtien and in Hinche [HostilityOther: Physical]. As a

ensuring the security of the prisons and well-being of detainees. Assessments
revealed considerable infrastructural damage to the prisons including the
administration facilities, resulting in even more limited cell space and dire detention
conditions. Prison administration is a challenge in view of the loss of files and
registries during the earthquake, which contributes to increased instances of
arbitrary and prolonged pretrial detention. Current activities focus on the training of

public policy, empowering civil society organizations and addressing impunity),
towards protection in relief efforts immediately after the earthquake. With the
support of additional staff from the Office of the United Nations High
Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) and the Office of the United Nations
High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), the Mission assumed its lead of the
humanitarian protection cluster and, in coordination with the Government of Haiti,
worked to coordinate an effective response by all actors [HumanitarianRelief: Assist with IA]. Priorities included:
protection of the earthquake-affected population, including those in spontaneous
camps., inclusion of human rights standards and principles in the relief efforts as
well as in policymaking for reconstruction., monitoring the human rights situation in
other affected areas, especially those hosting large numbers of internally displaced
persons., and ensuring participation in the protection efforts of the Government, the
national human rights institution (Office du Protecteur du Citoyen) and
non-governmental organizations [RefugeeAssistance, HumanRIghts, CivilSocietyAssistance: Assist with IA]. Medium- and long-term priorities include
enhancing the capacity of the Office du Protecteur du Citoyen and other national
entities, including non-governmental organizations, to promote and protect human

its efforts in the emergency phase on supporting the operational capacity of the
Haitian National Police to maintain security and public order [PoliceReform: AssistOther, Operations_PatrolsInterventions: Assist]. Increased patrols and
security at key locations, including banks and warehouses, helped to create
confidence, deter looting and foster early re-establishment of economic activity. As
settlements for displaced persons expanded, the focus of police activity has shifted
to protection in those locations, especially for the most vulnerable. United Nations
police and the Haitian National Police have established a permanent joint presence
in the two largest camps for internally displaced persons in Port-au-Prince, located
at the Pétionville Club and Cité Soleil [RefugeeAssistance: ProvideSecurity]. Community policing bases staffed by female
officers of the Haitian National Police and United Nations police have been

deployment stocks were released from the United Nations Logistics Base at
Brindisi, Italy, to help restore Mission capacity as well as to support humanitarian
agencies. The MINUSTAH Logistics Base in Port-au-Prince, which suffered
relatively little damage, became the centre of operations for most United Nations
actors, and provided space and basic facilities to many non-United Nations
humanitarian responders [HumanitarianRelief: MaterialSupport]. To accommodate the additional personnel arriving after
the earthquake, MINUSTAH relocated some staff to an adjacent camp that had been
previously prepared for incoming military forces. The establishment of an office in
Santo Domingo to provide services not requiring a physical presence in Haiti has
proven critical in enabling the Mission to move staff out of Port-au-Prince, where
living conditions remain extremely difficult, while allowing them to continue to
perform their functions. A land logistics corridor was also established between Portau-
Prince and Santo Domingo, using freight-forwarding contractors and military
assets to facilitate the movement of critical supplies. Moreover, regular shuttle
flights were established to facilitate the movement of personnel between Santo
Domingo and Port-au-Prince.";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;MaterialSupport;;;;

distributions are now winding down, with the focus shifting to longer-term food
security and investments in human capital. Programmes will include: support to
local markets., local procurement., and cash-for-work and food-for-work programmes
to support economic activity and agricultural rehabilitation. To ensure access to food
for the most vulnerable, WFP is providing meals for school-age children, nutrition
programmes for pregnant and nursing mothers and their children, and supporting
institutions and hospitals. It is also working with the Haitian authorities to
pre-position emergency supplies for the rainy and hurricane seasons.";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;ProvideSecurity,InternationalActor;;;;

Acting Principal Deputy Special Representative. A small team from Headquarters
also deployed to MINUSTAH to support emergency functions and the MINUSTAH

in the area of security. Increased collaboration between MINUSTAH, the Haitian
National Police and the Haitian public contributed to a more effective response to
threats from criminal elements. Meanwhile, efforts to enhance the capacity of the

which has been exacerbated by socio-economic circumstances, including the
suffering brought about by the storms and, more recently, by tensions related to the
ongoing electoral process, which could be manipulated for political or criminal
reasons. At a time when the Haitian National Police is still developing the capacity
to respond to such threats on its own, the present configuration and mandate of
MINUSTAH, as approved by the Security Council in October 2008, will enable the
Mission to continue to play its role in maintaining the country’s stability.

the areas of administrative capacities of governing institutions at all levels,
integrated border management and border security, all of which are closely linked to
its core mandated responsibilities [StateAdministration: Assist, BorderControl: Assist, ProvideSecurity]. However, it remains essential to find ways to
enhance the country’s broader administrative and governance capacity and to
improve the Government’s ability to deliver basic services to its people, which is
critical for stability. While a number of bilateral initiatives are under way, their
overall impact would be enhanced through improved coordination within an

impact on MINUSTAH. The Mission provided extensive assistance to the Haitian
authorities and the United Nations country team to facilitate the provision and
coordination of humanitarian assistance and access by humanitarian workers,
including through large-scale transportation operations [HumanitarianReleif: Assist, MaterialSupport]. At the same time, the storms
led to the loss of certain United Nations-owned equipment and critical supplies,

for Agricultural Development provided $10 million to support efforts to boost
agricultural production. The World Food Programme (WFP) distributed 12,306 tons
of food to 646,926 direct beneficiaries, including 9,357 tons in Gonaïves, totalling
$37 million. The beginning of the 2008/09 school year represented a particular
challenge for the Government and its partners. Up to 98 per cent of the cost of
school meals was funded by partners, in particular WFP, which provided $17.2
million in assistance. Labour-intensive programmes conducted jointly by United
Nations agencies focused on the environment and the rehabilitation of infrastructure
and helped to create 500,000 temporary jobs. Some 3.7 million children were

MINUSTAH_S/2008/586;66;1119;"65. In my last report to the Council, I provided an initial outline of five key areas
in which progress is essential for the consolidation of stability in Haiti: the
resolution of political differences through dialogue and completion of the election
cycle., the extension of State authority., the establishment of an appropriate security
structure., the development of independent, credible and effective judicial and penal
institutions., and improvement in socio-economic development.

had an impact on the timeline according to which progress in these areas can be
achieved, these broad objectives remain valid. Accordingly, in response to the
request of the Security Council in its resolution 1780 (2007), MINUSTAH has
continued to develop planning in each of these areas in consultation with Haitian
authorities, including President Préval [NationalReconciliation, StateAuthority, EconomicDevelopment: Assist, PoliceReform, JusticeSectorReform: AssistPolicies (activity categories are based on the areas mentioned in Para 65)]. This has permitted the elaboration of the
initial outline and the identification of some further indicators to measure and track

Haitian National Police and MINUSTAH jointly initiated an information campaign
in schools to increase children’s awareness of women’s rights and of punishable
crimes under the Penal Code such as rape and domestic violence [SexualViolence, Gender, ChildRights: Outreach]. The Mission
conducted a series of regional workshops in June to identify obstacles to the
participation of women in politics [Gender, PartyAssistance: Implement]. The protection of the rights of women and

proposals to establish specialized chambers within the Port-au-Prince jurisdiction
that would cover high-profile cases, including kidnappings and financial crimes, an
initiative that would complement ongoing efforts to strengthen the investigative
capacity of the police. The support of the new Government will be essential to
further progress in this area. In addition, the Government, with support from
MINUSTAH and other partners, has launched a programme to reorganize and

included the successive reduction of 300 troops in August 2006, following the
completion of the presidential elections, and a further reduction of 140 troops in
August 2007, after the termination of major operations in Cité Soleil. Corresponding
adjustments in the police component led to an overall increase of nearly 200

an indispensable role in ensuring stability. In addition to targeted operations, the
Mission military component maintained regular patrolling throughout the country,
including along the coasts and land border, and has increased its aerial surveillance
with the deployment of an additional aircraft [Operations_PatrolsInterventions, BorderControl: Implement]. The deployment of the maritime
police component in the vicinity of key ports will further complement these ongoing
efforts by helping to promote security, extend State authority, deter trafficking and
favour enhanced revenue collection by Haitian authorities. At the same time,
complementary bilateral initiatives and cooperation will remain essential to assure
the effectiveness of this additional deployment. Meanwhile, within and around

half of 2008, albeit never reaching the 2006 levels. Since the successful anti-gang
operations of 2006 and 2007, kidnappings seem to be primarily motivated by
ransom and are confined to the country’s larger cities. While some kidnappings
appear to be opportunistic, others are carried out by organized groups. The Haitian
National Police and MINUSTAH have worked together to forge an effective
response, including through improved information-sharing, strengthening of the
Haitian National Police’s anti-kidnapping cell and heightened patrols, and improved
communication with the public [PoliceReform: AssistOther, Operations_PatrolsInterventions: Assist]. The United Nations is also working with Member
States to promote increased bilateral support for the Haitian National Police and to
enhance capacity within the Mission, including through the deployment of
specialized police personnel. In addition, contacts have been made with the
International Criminal Police Organization (INTERPOL) to identify through their
network specialists who could assist. Following the arrest of several suspected
kidnappers, including apparent organizers, kidnappings declined in July, when their
number stood at less than half of the average monthly figure for the previous six
months. In addition, MINUSTAH is working with the Haitian authorities to improve
coordination between the Haitian National Police and the judicial system to ensure
that kidnappers are rapidly brought to trial [PoliceReform, JusticeSectorReform: AssistOther].";;;;;;;;;;Assist,AssistOther;;Assist;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

turned to violent attacks against the Government and MINUSTAH [HostilityOther: Violent]. In the following
days, protests spread to other cities, including Port-au-Prince. In the capital,
demonstrators erected barricades at crossroads, set tires ablaze and looted
businesses and residences, resulting in several deaths, many injuries and significant
damage to property. All available Haitian security forces and MINUSTAH military

giving grounds for hope while also highlighting the need for continued efforts.
Continued collaboration among the political leadership has permitted the adoption
of a legal framework for the judiciary and agreement on the terms of Senators and
on the establishment of the Provisional Electoral Council. Furthermore, with the
contribution of the MINUSTAH military and police, the security situation has
improved considerably in the past year. In cooperation with the authorities of Haiti,
the Mission has adjusted its profile and operation so as to tackle criminal activity in
the capital. The Mission also initiated its redeployment along the country’s borders
to reinforce the authority of the State [BorderControl, StateAuthority: Implement (based on para 19, it seems that only MINUSTAH are deployed without state agents)]. Significant, if incremental, progress has been
made in the implementation of rule-of-law reform programmes, along with renewed
efforts to strengthen other State institutions. Macroeconomic indicators have

that had not been possible for decades.";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;Implement;;;Implement;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
MINUSTAH_S/2008/202;64;1093;"64. In that context, MINUSTAH has launched a process of consultations with the
authorities of Haiti to identify key benchmarks by which consolidation of the
emerging stability can be measured, as requested by the Security Council in its
resolution 1780 (2007) [Meeting as an engagement level for the following activity categories]. As reflected in the present report, those initial discussions
suggest that critical milestones could include:
(a) Continued progress in the resolution of political differences through
dialogue and the successful completion of a cycle of elections that culminates in the
smooth installation of a democratically chosen President and legislature in 2011 [NationalReconciliation: Meeting].,
(b) The establishment of a sustainable security structure that would enable
Haiti to respond effectively to potential threats within the country and along its land
and maritime borders while respecting international standards and individual
freedoms. This would include the creation of a basic policing capacity of
14,000 officers, envisaged to be in place by 2011, and the establishment of related
institutional structures, as stipulated by the Haitian National Police reform plan,
together with adequate arrangements for border security [PoliceReform, BorderControl: Meeting].,
(c) The establishment of an independent and credible judicial and penal
system that respects and upholds human rights and is accessible to all citizens [JusticeSectorReform: Meeting].
Within the area of the justice system, key measurements of progress could include
the establishment of the Superior Council of the Judiciary and progress in the
implementation of a certification process. It would also include the opening of the
School for Magistrates and progress in the training of a critical mass of magistrates,
prosecutors and other judicial actors. The completion of investigations and trials in
connection with a number of high-profile cases involving corruption and organized
crime could also make a key difference in strengthening public confidence in the
justice system. Within the penal system, it is vital to undertake, in accordance with
the reform plan, the infrastructural improvements required to prevent the gross
abuse of the human rights of those subject to incarceration and to facilitate the
reinsertion of those who have been released.,
(d) The extension of State authority throughout the country through the
establishment of legitimate, transparent and accountable democratic State
institutions, down to the local level, with the capacity to collect and disburse funds
for the benefit of the population, including the establishment of a viable system of
border management [StateAuthority, DemocraticInstitutions, BorderControl: Meeting].
In addition to the achievement of the goals with regard to which MINUSTAH
has mandated responsibilities, lasting stability will require a tangible improvement
in the living standards of the population and the creation of conditions for economic
recovery. Key indicators of progress could include the availability of basic services
such as health care and education, together with an increase in State revenue, a
significant rise in GDP (with prospects for sustained growth over several
consecutive years), a rise in the employment rate and an increase in internal and
foreign direct investment.";;;;;;;Meeting;;;Meeting;;;;;;Meeting;Meeting;;;Meeting;;Meeting;;;;;;;;Meeting;;;;;;;

stability of Haiti. The passage into law of a framework for judicial independence
represented a significant step forward, complementing the earlier adoption of reform
plans for the police, judiciary and corrections sectors. It is essential that the plans be
translated into action and that the necessary national and international funding be
made available to support those reform processes. In accordance with efforts by
MINUSTAH to support the synchronized development of all rule-of-law
institutions [JusticeSectorReform: AssistOther], UNDP, in consultation with the Government, is working towards the
establishment of a joint rule-of-law trust fund, which could facilitate the

areas through a patrolling presence on land and will be further strengthened by the
deployment of a complementary maritime presence [BorderControl: Implement, ProvideSecurity, Operation_PatrolsInterventions: Implement]. Those efforts are intended
primarily to promote security and help extend State authority [StateAuthority: Implement]. It is expected that
they will also lead to increased revenue collection by the State. In addition, they
should help deter illegal trafficking activities, particularly those related to weapons

ongoing reform processes may deliberately seek to foster additional disturbances,
including through orchestrated acts of violence. In the regions outside of the capital,
the security situation remains generally calm, but occurrences of unrest and popular
justice have been reported. Suspected illicit trafficking activities along the coast and

points [PoliceReform: AssistPolicies, Gender: Assist]. The participation of women in the Haitian National Police is gradually
increasing. Women currently constitute 6 per cent of police officers, and
approximately 12 per cent of cadets in the current class are female. In August, the
Haitian National Police, with MINUSTAH support, carried out a registration
exercise to encourage women to join the police service, and thousands of women
applied for some 150 places in the Academy’s next class [PoliceReform: AssistOther, Gender: Assist]. MINUSTAH has also

institutional capacity of the Haitian National Police, including through close
coordination with donors [PoliceReform: AssistOther with IA]. Pledges and contributions by donors now total some
$46 million in support of the reform plan and are supporting the establishment of a
new General Inspectorate headquarters, the refurbishment of some police stations,
the provision of equipment for regular operations and the construction of a new
national Police Academy. MINUSTAH and the Haitian National Police are working
together on the preparation of a maritime police development plan aimed at

7,728 Haitian National Police officers are now undertaking policing duties. A
further 633 officers from the nineteenth class at the Police Academy are scheduled
to begin patrolling in late September 2007. This is in line with the Haitian National
Police reform plan, which envisaged that some 1,500 officers would graduate per
year. The police have adopted a new seven-month curriculum for basic training,
which is followed by three months of field training. The Mission is supporting both
the Academy and the curriculum. For officers who are already serving, the
monitoring and mentoring role of MINUSTAH police, including in field training,
has helped reinforce core values and raise skill levels as high as those of Academy
graduates [PoliceReform: AssistAgents].";;;;;;;;;;Assist,AssistAgents;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

since 19 December 2006, 27 reinsertion and community-based projects (valued at
$2.1 million) have reached various stages of implementation. Those projects are
facilitating the return of former gang members to their communities, reinforcing the
capacity of local communities to resolve conflicts peacefully, promoting a culture of
peace, assisting victims of violence and supporting the creation of temporary
employment. Several of the projects specifically target women, both as victims and
as perpetrators of armed violence [Gender: Assist]. So far, 381 individuals have entered the

MINUSTAH_S/2007/503;31;1039;"31. Although violence in Haiti diminished during the reporting period, it remains a
serious concern, in particular because of the prevalence of small arms held by
private citizens and the fact that non-traditional actors are involved in fomenting
instability. Traditional approaches to disarmament, however, do not address the
unique circumstances in Haiti. Recognizing the need for a fresh approach, the
Mission worked closely with national counterparts, the United Nations country team
and donors to develop a community violence reduction programme [NOT DDR but CVR]. That process
was informed by a United Nations assessment mission, as well as by a conference of
leading national and international experts dealing with gang violence, which was
held in Port-au-Prince.";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
MINUSTAH_S/2007/503;26;1038;"26. In July, the Mission conducted a detailed threat assessment, which identified
three security threats facing Haiti. First, there is the likelihood of civil unrest, which
is increased by an environment marked by the persistence of a deep socio-economic
divide and compounded by high unemployment and high expectations on the part of
the people. Secondly, the potential for renewed armed violence within the country
remains considerable. Despite the fact that many suspected criminals have been
apprehended in 2007, relatively few weapons have been confiscated, and many
former gang members, who could be persuaded to resume their gang activities by
spoilers with political or criminal motives, remain at large. Thirdly, the illicit traffic
in drugs, arms and contraband remains a critical factor [ControlSALW: Monitor]. If not addressed, illicit
trafficking will continue to corrupt State institutions. Corruption, and its acceptance
throughout society, will continue to foster impunity. It should be noted that, while
incidents of kidnapping have significantly decreased in 2007, the phenomenon still
represents a threat.";;;Monitor;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
MINUSTAH_S/2007/503;24;1037;"24. Recent security operations also brought significant improvement in Gonaïves,
where gangs had become entrenched. Following a number of violent incidents,
including the brutal murders of a Fanmi Lavalas spokesman and of the Director of
Radio Gonaïves, MINUSTAH and the Haitian National Police stepped up security
operations in early May [Operations_PatrolsInterventions: Assist]. During two months of intensified activity focusing largely
on the volatile shanty towns, some 90 individuals were arrested.";;;;;;;;;;;;Assist;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
MINUSTAH_S/2007/503;23;1036;"23. In Martissant, gang rivalry was a source of violence. In January alone, 29
bodies were discovered. MINUSTAH and the Haitian National Police conducted a
series of targeted arrests that led to a sharp decrease in the level of violence. On
22 January, an office was established co-locating MINUSTAH military, police and
civilian components with the Haitian National Police [PoliceReform: MaterialSupport]. The Haitian National Police
and MINUSTAH now carry out joint patrols, which have been welcomed by the
population [Operations_PatrolsInterventions: Assist]. However, while gang violence has declined, there has been a
corresponding increase in public lynching.

MINUSTAH_S/2007/503;22;1035;"22. The dialogue with members of armed groups initiated by the Government in
July 2006 aimed at achieving voluntary disarmament proved unfruitful, prompting
the Government and MINUSTAH to increase pressure on the gangs. A series of
intensive and intelligence-driven security operations in urban areas, particularly in
Port-au-Prince and Gonaïves, restored them to State authority. From 22 December
2006 to 28 February 2007, MINUSTAH and the Haitian National Police conducted a
total of 19 security operations in Cité Soleil and Martissant. Those operations
dislodged the main gang leaders and, together with other joint operations throughout
the country, led to the arrest of some 850 suspected gang members by the end of
July [Operations_UseofForce: Assist]. Initially, members of armed groups launched sustained counter-attacks,
injuring six peacekeepers [HostilityOther: Violent]. However, armed resistance decreased markedly after two
main gang leaders fled the area. Those operations paved the way for the Haitian
National Police, supported by MINUSTAH, to return to those areas and, in March,
to begin joint patrols in Cité Soleil [Operations_PatrolsInternvetions: Assist].";;;;;;;;;;;;Assist;Assist;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
MINUSTAH_S/2007/503;17;1034;"17. Lack of control by Haiti of its land and sea borders is a factor of instability
affecting the sustainability of the political and economic governance, security and
institutional development of the country. Given its 1,600 miles of unprotected
coastline, its unguarded seaports and its numerous clandestine airstrips, the country
is subject to penetration by those engaged in illicit trafficking, including in arms and
drugs, whose activities could create renewed instability if they are not stopped.
There have been widespread reports of trafficking activities across the land border
and via the ports and coastline, as well as the many small airstrips, of Haiti. The
Mission’s threat assessment (see para. 26) identified illicit trafficking and the
consequent corruption of institutions as significant threats to stability [BorderControl: Monitor]. The loss of
State revenue resulting from the dysfunctional customs service and port
administration is also significant.";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;Monitor;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
MINUSTAH_S/2007/503;16;1033;"16. In keeping with Government priorities, the Mission, together with the United
Nations country team, will continue to focus on extending State authority and
building local capacity, particularly with regard to public service delivery, the
development of local taxation and the promotion of good governance [StateAuthority, StateAdministration: Assist with IA]. In doing so, it
will be essential to foster links between institutions at the local level, support State
reform and decentralization and promote transparency and the fight against
corruption. Complementary bilateral support is crucial to meet infrastructure
requirements and to supplement the Mission’s expertise, particularly in areas such as
the property register, capacity-building, including of the civil service, and the

establishing municipal councils by providing technical expertise on topics such as
budgetary principles and management [DemocraticInstitutions: Assist]. The Mission also supported training
programmes for 58 comptrollers [DemocraticInstitutions: Assist]. In order to respond to urgent needs and to help
local authorities to deliver a minimum level of functioning local governance,
MINUSTAH supported 166 quick-impact projects ($2.02 million), including 92 to
rehabilitate public buildings essential for the functioning of local government [StateAdministration: MaterialSupport]. An
additional quick-impact project ($200,000) is being implemented with the Ministry
of Interior and Local Government to provide all mayors and departmental delegates

that the Haitian National Police would increase from its current strength by a rate of
approximately 1,500 officers a year, to 14,000 by 2011. The plan notes that the latter
figure should be sufficient to undertake essential policing functions. At the same
time, it indicates that further security capacity, up to a total staffing of 20,000,
would be required to undertake the full range of security tasks, and that an
appropriate plan would need to be devised for its development. To date, some 8,070
Haitian National Police officers and 1,580 civilian employees have been registered
within a United Nations police database which will also serve the Haitian National
Police. A further 600 candidates for the Haitian National Police, including 30
women, will begin training courses in January 2007. With regard to gender
representation, some 6.5 per cent of Haitian National Police officers and 12 per cent
of Haitian National Police employees are women. In an effort to combat
discrimination against women within the institution and ensure that gender is
mainstreamed in all their activities, the Haitian National Police have recently
established gender focal points throughout the country. They are currently
undergoing training in collaboration with MINUSTAH [PoliceReform: AssistAgents, Gender: Assist]. The Mission, the Joint
United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) and the United Nations

has remained limited [DDR started]. Only two groups totalling 104 individuals have formally
entered the disarmament and reintegration programme. Furthermore, while their
participation may have contributed to a decline in violence and kidnappings in the
short term, it is clear that it has not resulted in a meaningful step towards the
dismantlement of the gangs. Several participants are suspected of continuing their
engagement in criminal activities. Meanwhile, MINUSTAH and the United Nations
Development Programme (UNDP) are working in close coordination with the
Government to support the strengthening of the legislative framework for small

reporting period. On a number of occasions MINUSTAH troops have found bodies
in the area, with the deaths attributed to suspicious causes. As part of the joint
Government/MINUSTAH plan to restore security, the Mission organized a series of
meetings between local authorities and residents [didn't cote this as no suitable activity category was found]. On 27 September, MINUSTAH
troops apprehended a significant armed group leader who had been linked to the
large-scale killings in Martissant in both 2005 and 2006. On 3 November, a group of
armed criminals in Martissant were confronted by the Haitian National Police and a
MINUSTAH formed police unit, resulting in the death of one civilian and the

was observed in Cité Soleil and Cité Militaire, following the reinforcement of the
Mission’s presence there. Furthermore, on 2 October, MINUSTAH and the
Government agreed to establish a communication mechanism at the highest level to
plan future joint operations in Cité Soleil and set up a coordination, monitoring and

Police officers accompanied by MINUSTAH visited Cité Soleil to meet local
residents and community leaders and to look into the possibility of resuming patrols
and re-establishing a Haitian National Police presence in the area [PoliceReform: AssistOther (this could be seen as ""provision of security"")]. This first visit of
the Haitian police to Cité Soleil in almost three years was welcomed by local

expressions of frustration, which could have implications for Haitian and
international efforts to promote progress. On 24 October, a group of some 30
students gathered near a United Nations Day ceremony in Port-au-Prince, holding
anti-MINUSTAH placards and calling for the withdrawal of the peacekeepers [HostilityOther: Verbal]. The
next day, some 600 students held a similar protest near the Presidential Palace, and
roadblocks with burning tyres were erected [HostilityOther: Physical]. In response, the Minister for Foreign
Affairs urged students not to resort to violence, but noted that the demonstrations
illustrated the public’s impatience at the lack of socio-economic progress.";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

relatively stable in most of the country and there were signs of improvement in
some critical areas. However, the overall situation remained fragile and volatile.
Much of the violence continued to take place in the capital., other regions of the
country enjoyed a greater level of stability, with the exception of isolated incidents
reported in Fort Liberté, Cap Haïtien and Gonaïves. Although kidnappings
continued to take place at a high rate throughout Port-au-Prince, they occurred less
frequently than last year, and murder rates also showed some decline. However,
armed attacks against MINUSTAH and violent demonstrations increased [HostilityOther: Violent]. The
development of Haitian National Police capacity remained at a very early stage, and
the Mission’s military and police components continued to play a key role in
promoting its capacity in the face of substantial challenges, working in close
cooperation with the Haitian political and police leadership [PoliceReform: AssistOther].";;;;;;;;;;Assist,AssistOther;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

workers, and assistance with the logistics for the collection and storage of sensitive
and non-sensitive material from some 9,231 polling stations throughout the country.
MINUSTAH worked closely with the Haitian National Police to implement a joint
security plan. The military component provided static security for voting centres in
areas identified as high-risk, and the Haitian National Police and MINUSTAH

these elections have taken place, the new Government will need to enhance the
operational structures to support a permanent electoral management body, as well to
keep the voters roll updated and further develop the national capacity to organize
future elections. Elected local authorities will soon need to vote for municipal and
departmental assemblies. International assistance for such post-electoral activities,
above all from bilateral and regional partners, such as the Organization of American
States and the Caribbean Community, could be complemented with MINUSTAH
and UNDP assistance, should the Haitian authorities so request.";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;Assist;;;;;;;;;;;;;

political leaders and people, with MINUSTAH support, in creating a level of mutual
collaboration that has rarely existed. The newly elected leadership has indicated its
strong commitment to continuing this process, which it must lead. The Mission
stands ready to continue to assist the Haitian authorities in this work [NationalReconciliation: Assist (the language is a bit vague)], as requested,

enhanced crime prevention role by increasing substantially their patrolling in
support of the Haitian National Police in Port-au-Prince, Cap Haïtien and Gonaïves [Operations_PatrolsInterventions: Implement].
For this purpose, MINUSTAH will need to retain its eight formed police units,
which represents a total of 1,000 officers. To enhance the ability of MINUSTAH to
deliver operational support to the Haitian National Police, in view of the rising gang
violence, at least half of these formed police units would need to include personnel
and equipment qualified for special weapons and tactics (SWAT).";;;;;;;;;;;;;Implement;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

to deter and respond to illicit activities in the coastal areas. In meetings with my
Special Representative, President Préval has expressed concern about specific issues
such as smuggling and the lack of proper customs administration in Haiti and has
requested increased technical assistance from MINUSTAH military and police

by patrolling in towns and their surroundings, protecting key installations,
protecting United Nations personnel and facilities, providing operational support to
the Haitian National Police and MINUSTAH police operations, and facilitating the
access of humanitarian workers to the Haitian people in need [Operations_PatrolsInterventions: Implement, PoliceReform: AssistOther, HumanitarianRelief: ProvideSecurity]. Protecting civilians
under imminent threat, within the Mission’s capabilities and areas of deployment,
will also remain a key task. However, as described above, main factors that
destabilize security are gang violence and kidnappings. Without significant added
specialized police capacities, the ability of MINUSTAH to respond to crime, as
distinct from containing or deterring it and protecting civilians in danger, is limited [CivilianProtection: Implement].";;;;;;Implement;;;;Assist,AssistOther;;Implement;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;ProvideSecurity;;;;

made it possible for humanitarian and development actors to reach out to the groups
most affected by the chronic emergency conditions. In Cité Soleil, the United
Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) and the World Health Organization/Pan
American Health Organization carried out a vaccination campaign for children and
provided school equipment while the World Food Programme continued to provide
food aid. The United Nations country team task force for Cité Soleil, comprising
representatives of MINUSTAH, donors and non-governmental organizations, was
established to coordinate the conduct of assessment missions to, and interventions
in, the shantytown. Four United Nations inter-agency assessment missions had
already been carried out in the sectors of health, education, infrastructure, and water

generally stable but fragile., early in July, however, it started to deteriorate sharply.
While criminal activities by armed groups, in particular kidnappings, had started to
decline in the capital in January and February, their levels increased again in June
and continued to create an obstacle to the restoration of law and order. Although the
number of reported cases remained much lower than the peak registered in
December 2005, the increase in acts of violence in the capital, particularly
kidnappings and killings, largely dominated public debate and media reports. While
a large proportion of the increase in violence is related to common crime, it
nonetheless affected the political situation, and prompted increased criticism by
political and civil society groups of a perceived inadequate response to the issue by
the Government and MINUSTAH. To respond to these developments, MINUSTAH
and the Government officials jointly designed an integrated security plan, with
increased checkpoints and joint patrols, which was put in place on 10 July [Operations_PatrolsInterventions: Assist]. It should
be recognized, however, that MINUSTAH, unless it is provided with specialized
police capacities, has only a limited capability and mandate to address what is
essentially a domestic law enforcement task. Its main contribution will be
strengthening Haitian National Police capacity.";;;;;;;;;;;;Assist;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

to win the election in the first round. By 13 February, large-scale demonstrations
were taking place across the country, causing serious disruption. During that time,
the ability of MINUSTAH to maintain a secure and stable environment was
stretched to its limits [ElectoralSecurity: Implement]. Roadblocks were erected along all main roads and the airport

intensity, resulting in the deaths of 24 people, with five persons still missing.
Hurricane Wilma and Tropical Storm Alpha were responsible for most of the
casualties and for causing severe damage to houses, schools, infrastructure and
agriculture. Additional assistance is needed to help some 300 families to rebuild
their houses and to help fishermen in the coastal area in the south who lost their
means of subsistence. The coordinated efforts of national authorities, MINUSTAH

contingency plan for natural disasters, helped minimize the loss of life and property
through pre-emptive actions and immediate relief assistance [HumanitarianRelief: Assist]. Meanwhile, efforts to
tackle the effects of the drought in 2005, which was exacerbated by Hurricanes
Dennis and Emily, progressed in the mountainous areas of the south. The
distribution of agricultural goods benefiting some 31,000 families was organized by

participation as a member of the National Coordination Committee on the
Prevention of Violence against Women [SexualViolence: Meeting (Assuming that the Committee involves government representatives]. The purpose of the work is both to
strengthen prevention and to develop a range of activities to fight violence against

out under the intimidation of weapons, there has been a high occurrence of gang
rapes and that as much as 50 per cent of the rape victims have been minors.
However, it seems that few cases of violence are reported to the justice and security

Rivière du Nord in October 2005 but, despite evidence brought to its attention, the
Haitian National Police failed to open investigations into the matter. Following

killings in the Solino and Bel-Air areas of Port-au-Prince and the reports were
brought to the attention of the Haitian authorities [PoliceReform: Monitor], but again no action was taken.

judicial and corrections capacity will require Haitian action to strengthen the
structural and legal underpinnings of the judicial system. On 28 December 2005, the
Transitional Government adopted a decree on the Superior Council of the Judiciary,
which, while presenting some shortcomings, has the merit of establishing a judicial
inspectorate and disciplinary measures for magistrates. It is also essential that laws
be adopted on the statute of the magistrates and the school of magistrates.";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

if it is accompanied by comprehensive progress in the justice and corrections
systems. A wide-ranging review of the two systems, conducted by MINUSTAH in

highlighted a number of serious weaknesses that carry important implications
regarding respect for human rights, security and political stability [HumanRights, JusticeSectorReform, PrisonReform: Monitor].";;;;;;;Monitor;;;;;;;;;Monitor;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
MINUSTAH_S/2006/60;33;967;"33. Haitian National Police reform will be further promoted by MINUSTAH
through a certification programme for individual officers and units within the
national police. It is envisaged that the Mission would issue provisional
certification, which would be valid for an initial period of 12 months, to those
officers now serving on the ground. The provisional certification would be
renewable based on the officer’s observance of the necessary standards, as well as
on satisfactory results from vetting. In accordance with Security Council resolutions
1542 (2004) and 1608 (2005), recommendations by MINUSTAH would be
implemented by the Haitian authorities, who remain responsible for all personnel
decisions and would ensure that individuals without certification will not serve in
the Haitian National Police. This process will culminate in the final certification of
officers, units and ultimately the Haitian National Police as a whole, when the
institution has reached the level of capacity at which ongoing monitoring [PoliceReform: Monitor] is no
longer required. Continued constructive cooperation by the Haitian National Police
at all levels, as well as political support from Haitian authorities, is essential for
effective reform and the development of a competent, professional police force.";;;;;;;;;;Monitor;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

officers currently on the ground [PoliceReform: AssistOther]. This process, which entails identifying the
individuals who are currently serving and the serial number of their weapons, can
help clarify current police capabilities and provide a baseline for future development
efforts. By the end of January, 4,492 national police officers and staff had been
registered. A class of 778 national police officers completed training at the Police
Academy on 20 September and were deployed in Port-au-Prince in early October.

effectiveness of the Haitian National Police and limit public confidence in it. While
significant progress has been made under the Haitian National Police Director
General, Mario Andrésol, there are elements within Haiti who do not fully support
the reform of the police. The potential for resistance to reform measures was made
clear by the response to the arrest on 4 November of two senior national police
officers for alleged obstruction of the investigation into the killings that took place
in Martissant on 20 August (S/2005/631, para. 36). A series of small demonstrations
were staged against the Director General and several MINUSTAH vehicles were
spray-painted with slogans [HostilityOther: Physical]. MINUSTAH and the Core Group issued a joint

disarmament, demobilization and reintegration process has been developed in
collaboration with the National Commission for Disarmament and has been
presented to the Conseil supérieur de la police nationale [DisarmamentDemobilization, Reinteration: Assist]. Reintegration of members
of armed groups could be promoted by development of alternatives to processing
through the justice system, including national reconciliation mechanisms, such as
limited forms of amnesty. In the interim, MINUSTAH is working with the

limited progress on security sector reform, lack of clarity on the future status of the
former military and limited job creation, and large numbers of weapons remain in

people and will need to continue under Haitian leadership. An inclusive approach
after the elections will be essential. Further progress on the national dialogue would
enable Haitian society to reach a common position on outstanding issues resulting
from past political divisions and violence, and could help reinforce the legitimacy of
the new administration. The appointment of leaders for the national dialogue
process, who are representative of the political spectrum and are individuals of
widely recognized integrity, could contribute to the constructive re-engagement of
potentially violent elements. MINUSTAH would continue to assist this work as

National Police has been reinforced by recent, deeply disturbing reports of the
involvement of some of its officers in serious crimes and human rights violations.
However, there have been marked improvements in the level of cooperation and in
the attitude of the Haitian national police leadership. The full commitment of the
Haitian authorities to end impunity and develop professional values will be crucial

banditry and violence. During the past three months, at least four cases of alleged
summary executions have been investigated by the MINUSTAH Joint Special
Investigation Unit [HumanRights, PoliceReform, Operations_UseofForce: Monitor]. Furthermore, in some instances where police officers were found
to have been involved in flagrant cases of misconduct, disciplinary measures that
were taken served to protect them from formal inquiry and judicial prosecution. The

widely interpreted as accusations that Fanmi Lavalas members had been involved in
the murder and calling for the banning of Fanmi Lavalas. Investigations by
MINUSTAH and the Haitian National Police into the kidnapping and subsequent
murder suggested that the crime was politically motivated, but could not
conclusively establish responsibility [HumanRights: Monitor (Not sure about the activity category.

MINUSTAH_S/2005/313;61;930;"61. I remain deeply concerned about the human rights situation and the impunity
enjoyed by those who commit violations of human rights. There is an urgent
demand for justice in Haiti. I appeal to the Transitional Government to set the
example by promptly initiating an investigation into those human rights violations
allegedly committed by national police officers. The State institutions responsible
for guaranteeing respect for the rule of law — including the police, the justice and
prison systems — remain particularly weak. I therefore encourage the Transitional
Government to explore practical means by which the international community might
provide immediate assistance to expedite some of the most sensitive cases.
Furthering the reform of the justice and penal systems should be pursued in parallel
to the efforts to professionalize the police. Demonstrable progress in these key areas
will be crucial to building the confidence of the Haitian population in its national
institutions. The commitment of the Transitional Government and the police to take
the reform forward, as well as to work effectively with MINUSTAH in police
operations and reform [PoliceReform: AssistOther], also needs to be strengthened. I urge the Transitional
Government to ensure that the technical advice and recommendations provided by
the Mission’s civilian police officers are implemented by national police officers at
all levels [PoliceReform: AssistAgents, AssistOther].

These activities are carried out in close cooperation with OAS. It is essential to
ensure the transparency and credibility of the ballot to encourage broad

been accorded due process. Further to the proposals contained in my report of April
2004 (S/2004/300, paras. 35-38), the Mission is working closely with the
Transitional Government to expedite the judicial procedures for all cases of
prolonged pre-trial detention, and exploring possible solutions such as the
establishment of an ad hoc commission to review the cases of detainees [JusticeSectorReform: AssistOther, PrisonReform: Assist (Training doesn't code PrisonReform, but I coded it as the category includes procedures related to detention according to the codebook)]. More
generally, the Transitional Government requires assistance to overcome the
deficiencies in the justice and penal sectors. MINUSTAH is exploring with the
respective Haitian institutions the possibility of playing a more direct and proactive
role in this area, including through the appointment of international experts, acting
as monitors and/or observers, exercising direct technical follow-up of certain
proceedings, and providing legal advice to the judiciary [JusticeSectorReform: Monitor].";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;Assist;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
MINUSTAH_S/2005/313;49;927;"49. In order to enhance the Mission’s activities to professionalize the Haitian
National Police, the police component plans to strengthen its involvement in the
vetting programme [PoliceReform: AssistOther], which will encompass not only new recruits but also current
officers., in investigations related to human rights abuses or other serious security
incidents [HumanRights: Assist]., and in election-related activities [ElectoralSecurity: AssistOther]. MINUSTAH experience in assisting the
national police has shown the pressing need to strengthen the role of civilian police
officers in providing practical guidance to the Haitian police at all levels. In order to
address these needs, MINUSTAH will require that the numbers making up the
seventh formed police unit and the strengthened Jordanian unit be replenished by
new civilian police personnel (125 officers) whose deployment had been postponed
to allow for the establishment of the formed police units as well as 25 additional
officers. The total requirement proposed for the MINUSTAH police component is
275 additional personnel, which would raise the new police component ceiling from
1,622 to 1,897 police officers (including 1,000 officers in formed police units).

Cayes (1 unit) and Gonaïves (1 unit) to support the national police in static security
duties, general operational back-up and crowd control [PoliceReform: AssistOther, Operations_PatrolsInterventions: Assist]. To increase the Mission’s
ability to deal with potential civil disorder in connection with the electoral campaign
and the aftermath of the elections, MINUSTAH needs to reorient existing resources
and to enhance its coverage of the country with formed police units. It is envisaged
that one of the units currently in Port-au-Prince would move to Cap-Haïtien prior to
the elections. As previously reported (S/2004/908, para. 53), an additional formed
police unit of 125 officers within the current authorized strength would be deployed.
Of these, 40 personnel have already been added to one of the Jordanian units in
Port-au-Prince, and 85 officers from Senegal, constituting the seventh unit, will be
deployed to Hinche shortly. Since Hinche is likely to continue to be a particularly
sensitive area, this seventh unit should be deployed there on a permanent basis. In
addition to the already authorized force, one additional formed police units should
be deployed in Port-au-Prince as surge capacity until after the new government is
installed in February 2006. That unit would also serve as a tactical reserve, available
for deployment in whole or in part to provide assistance elsewhere in the country as

institutionalize and strengthen the co-location programme. The investigative
capacity of key units such as the judicial police, to which 14 MINUSTAH police
advisers have been assigned, has also been reinforced [PoliceReform, JusticeSectorReform: AssistOther]. Because of the lack of a
formal intelligence structure within the police, however, the current capacity for

who provided security for humanitarian activities [HumanitarianRelief: ProvideSecurity]. The situation in Gonaïves has
improved as a result of the coordinated efforts of the Transitional Government,
humanitarian organizations, United Nations agencies and MINUSTAH. Most basic
services have been restored, but structural problems, already present before the
disaster took place, will need to be addressed through more complex and long-term
programming. Since the beginning of the humanitarian response in Gonaïves, nearly
4,000 metric tons of food commodities from the World Food Programme have been
distributed in the affected areas. Since November 2004, as Gonaïves and other
affected areas recovered from the disaster, general food distribution was gradually
replaced by targeted programmes. Approximately 2,000 people who lost their homes
continue to live in some 20 temporary shelters in Gonaïves, Port-de-Paix and other
affected areas. Humanitarian organizations have made efforts to improve their living
conditions, but a durable solution has yet to be found.";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;ProvideSecurity;;;;
MINUSTAH_S/2005/124;40;897;"40. MINUSTAH and UNICEF, as well as national and international human rights
organizations, drew attention to continued violence against children. According to
witness testimony obtained by MINUSTAH, on 1 December 2004, while chasing
suspected gang members, HNP officers shot at students inside a school near the Bel-
Air district of Port-au-Prince, wounding several of them [PoliceReform, ChildRIghts, Operations_UseofForce: Monitor]. Officials working at the
morgue in the General Hospital in Port-au-Prince reported to MINUSTAH several
cases of street children being shot dead by unidentified assailants. According to
human rights groups and interviews conducted by MINUSTAH, among the
perpetrators of the violence against children in the capital were individuals dressed
in black, such as those who allegedly perpetrated the killings in the Fort National
district in October 2004 (see S/2004/908, para. 13) [HumanRights, ChildRights: Monitor]. This information has been
corroborated through investigations conducted by the United Nations Children’s
Fund (UNICEF) and the Haitian Office of the Ombudsman. MINUSTAH’s civilian
police and human rights officers are currently carrying out investigations of several
cases of alleged human rights violations [HumanRights: Monitor]. Some of these investigations are being
conducted in cooperation with the General Inspectorate of HNP (see paras. 17 and
35) [HumanRights: Monitor, Assist]. It is expected that the capacity of MINUSTAH in this area will soon be
expanded to enable it to conduct a larger number of such investigations. Gang
members have also been involved in violence against children. Human rights
organizations, local associations and medical staff at the main hospital inside Cité
Soleil told MINUSTAH that, during the months prior to the MINUSTAH/HNP
December 2004 operation in Cité Soleil, an estimated 30 to 40 children had
reportedly died violent deaths in the shantytown in the context of gang violence.
MINUSTAH has also received consistent testimony, including from eyewitnesses,
which indicated that children have played an active role in gang-related activities
such as the torching and pillaging of residences, vehicles and shops.

coordination with MINUSTAH and OAS. On 10 January 2005, a global funding
agreement for a total of $44.3 million was signed between the Transitional
Government, CEP, MINUSTAH and UNDP [ElectionAssistance: Assist, with IA]. The Government of Canada contributed
17 million Canadian dollars and the Government of the United States of America
$9.4 million to the OAS voter registration programme. The European Union and the
Transitional Government pledged €10 million and $2.9 million, respectively. UNDP
contributed $400,000. This will allow CEP to prepare for the elections with
activities such as infrastructure rehabilitation for voter registration offices and the
purchase of vehicles and office equipment. Funding, however, remains a concern.
Not only is there a shortfall of $5.6 million in the amount pledged to the global
funding agreement, but the budget on which the agreement was based will be
insufficient to allow CEP to carry out fully its necessary activities. Discussions are
ongoing between CEP, MINUSTAH, OAS and donors to review the budget,
determine the additional amount required and identify appropriate mechanisms to
provide the required financial support [ElectionAssistance: Meeting with IA]. The Prime Minister stressed the importance
of providing financial assistance not only to CEP, but also to political parties so that

presidential decree establishing the national commission for disarmament,
demobilization and reintegration, which would provide the national institutional
framework for the implementation of disarmament, demobilization and reintegration
programmes. Nonetheless, on 20 December, the Transitional Government
announced the launching of a compensation programme for those members of the
former military who were demobilized in 1995 and has made approximately
$2.8 million available for this purpose. Governmental delegations travelled to Cap
Haïtien, Les Cayes and Petit-Goâve to meet with former soldiers and to explain the
Government’s proposed compensation programme. Despite their willingness to
accept the indemnity they were offered, the former soldiers refused to disarm and
demanded the creation of an interim security force. Interim President Alexandre
reiterated that the possible reinstatement of the Haitian army would be examined by
the next elected Government of Haiti. Payment of the first of three instalments to
the demobilized soldiers began on 28 December 2004 and is expected to be
completed in March 2005 [DDR started]. MINUSTAH advised the Transitional Government that
any further payments should be linked to disarmament and entry into the

MINUSTAH_S/2005/124;11;882;"11. Although the general security environment across Haiti has improved, the
Mission’s determination to take action against gang members and former soldiers
has increased the risk of retaliation against MINUSTAH and other United Nations
personnel. During the reporting period, a number of incidents targeting MINUSTAH
personnel took place, including hostile fire and other aggressive acts encountered in
the course of military and police operations [Operations_PatrolsInterventions: Implement, HostilityOther: Violent]. On 21 November 2004, a United
Nations vehicle transporting 11 off-duty MINUSTAH military personnel in plain
clothes was carjacked by armed men who forced the driver to enter Cité Soleil. All
of the MINUSTAH personnel were released shortly thereafter and most of their
belongings returned. Three of the assailants were later detained by MINUSTAH and
handed over to HNP. On 10 January 2005, a clearly marked MINUSTAH ambulance
was fired upon by unknown assailants in Port-au-Prince., no casualties were
reported. Two days later, a MINUSTAH civilian police patrol came under heavy
gunfire in Port-au-Prince [Operations_PatrolsInterventions: Implement]. The vehicle was hit and disabled., the civilian police
officers had to flee on foot, chased by a group of 12 heavily armed assailants.

abandoned private residence of former President Aristide in the Port-au-Prince
suburb of Tabarre. Upon learning of the occupation, the Transitional Government
issued a communiqué outlawing “those who, in the name of the Haitian Army, seize
official vehicles, circulate in military fatigues and carry heavy weapons, and occupy
public and private buildings”. At the request of the Transitional Government,
MINUSTAH and HNP surrounded the residence in the early hours of 16 December.
A delegation from the Transitional Government and another one composed of
political parties and civil society leaders failed in their attempts to reach a negotiated solution. As a result, MINUSTAH troops took over the residence on
17 December and disarmed the 43 individuals who occupied it (16 of whom were
not demobilized soldiers) without firing any shots [Operations_PatrolsInterventions: Assist *interpreted this as an act of intervention in a joint operation with national police]. The self-styled leader of the

numerous arrests, but only an insignificant number of weapons were seized,
highlighting the difficulty of planning and organizing such operations in total

appealed to all Haitians not to let themselves be drawn into a vicious cycle of
revenge and violence and to embark on the path of dialogue, reconciliation and

National Plan on Sexual Violence against Women, which emphasizes the need to
strengthen coordinated actions of prevention and support to victims of gender-based
violence, including sexual violence, under the leadership of the Ministry for the
Status of Women [SexualViolence: Assist with IA]. MINUSTAH, together with UNAIDS, UNFPA and national

administration, including the central authorities in charge of local government,
regional delegates and municipal councils, during regular visits throughout the
country in advance of a full permanent presence [StateAuthority: Meeting]. This has helped MINUSTAH to
start identifying local needs and develop a municipal database. In consultation with
key institutions of central government, the Mission has also begun assessing needs
in the area of public administration, local management skills and good governance.
Municipal governments have expressed a keen interest in receiving training in those
areas. These initiatives will build upon ongoing UNDP programmes for the
modernization of State institutions and effective decentralization. A team of national
experts is currently working with the Prime Minister’s Office to fine-tune the legal
framework and conduct pilot initiatives, such as a registry of public servants at the
regional and municipal levels. MINUSTAH is working in conjunction with UNDP,

Mission will also develop a collaborative approach with other international
organizations willing to support the electoral process, in particular CARICOM.
MINUSTAH has begun to help support the Provisional Electoral Council and to

MINUSTAH_S/2004/698;28;852;"28. During the period under review, Fanmi Lavalas has shown signs of increasing
divisions, some prominent politicians previously associated with Fanmi Lavalas
having distanced themselves from the administration of former President Aristide.
There are also signs that some moderate members may be considering joining the
political transition process, if the Transitional Government were to take measures to
prevent political persecution. To capitalize on this momentum and as a continuation
of efforts undertaken by my Special Adviser early in June to facilitate a
rapprochement between the Transitional Government and Fanmi Lavalas,
MINUSTAH provided good offices in an effort to broker an agreement between
them on the entry of Fanmi Lavalas into the political transition process [PartyAssistance, NationalReconciliation: Assist]. A group of
former members of Fanmi Lavalas, led by former Senators Prince Pierre Sonson and
Dany Toussaint, formed a new political party on 31 July 2004 — the Mouvement
démocratique et réformateur haïtien (MODEREH). Although it has not formally
signed the Consensus on the Political Transition Pact, it has indicated that it intends
to compete in the next elections and be fully involved in the national dialogue by
advocating tolerance and reconciliation. With regard to political entities in general,
more than 70 political parties and new forces have appeared, so that the political
landscape in Haiti remains highly fragmented, even though during the period under
review a number of parties initiated negotiations to regroup or form coalitions.";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;Assist;;;;Assist;;;;;;;
MINUSTAH_S/2004/698;27;851;"27. Tensions have continued to characterize relations between Fanmi Lavalas and
the Transitional Government. Members of the party repeatedly alleged that they
were subjected to political persecution and staged public demonstrations to demand
the release of individuals they claim are political prisoners. The Transitional
Government’s decision to place a number of Fanmi Lavalas supporters on a list
barring them from leaving the country was criticized by Fanmi Lavalas and by a
number of human rights organizations. The arrest of former Prime Minister Yvon
Neptune on 27 June has been pointed to by many members of Fanmi Lavalas as
evidence of political persecution against them. While Mr. Neptune had been
detained for his alleged involvement in a massacre in Saint-Marc in February 2004,
to date no official charges have been brought against him. He remains in detention.
MINUSTAH has emphasized the need to promote the rule of law and to uphold the
presumption of innocence until found guilty [JusticeSectorReform: Advocate *Not sure whether this qualifies ""specific justice sector reforms"" as indicated in the codebook].";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

HNP class is scheduled to begin its training on 23 August. MINUSTAH assisted
HNP with the preparation of the six-month training programme to ensure that it is in
accordance with international policing and human rights standards [PoliceReform: AssistPolicies]. A “train-thetrainers”
programme was developed in July and will soon be implemented at the
HNP Academy in Port-au-Prince, employing 54 local police instructors.
MINUSTAH also set up a special training team that will assess needs and prepare a
training plan for HNP officers in the regions [PoliceReform: AssistOther]. In addition, a needs assessment is
under way at police stations in the Haitian capital to improve mechanisms in place
to respond to the cases of violence against women.";;;;;;;;;;Assist,AssistPolicies,AssistOther;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

the country, particularly the disarmament, demobilization and reintegration of all
armed groups., preparation of elections., and the reform, restructuring, development

MINUSTAH_S/2004/698;16;847;"16. The Transitional Government’s setting of a deadline for armed groups, other
than HNP, to stop claiming to exercise security functions (see para. 11 above)
underlines the urgency for it to put in place a disarmament, demobilization and
reintegration framework. Meanwhile, the Haitian authorities have somewhat
distanced themselves from that deadline. As a follow-up to the limited disarmament
activities of the Multinational Interim Force, MINUSTAH military forces, within
their capacities, have been as responsive as possible to information received about
weapons caches and have confiscated illegal weapons, when feasible [ControlSALW: Implement].";;;Implement;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
MINUSTAH_S/2004/698;14;846;"14. Assisting the Transitional Government with the comprehensive and sustainable
disarmament, demobilization and reintegration of all armed groups (estimated at a
total of 25,000 individuals) many of which are of an informal and unstructured
nature, is a formidable challenge for MINUSTAH. In the interim cooperation
framework document prepared by the Transitional Government with the support of
the international community (see para. 25 below), the Transitional Government
committed itself to the creation of a mixed inter-ministerial commission on
disarmament and the adoption of the required legal framework, which would
represent an important first step towards the development of a national
disarmament, demobilization and reintegration programme and set the framework
within which MINUSTAH and the United Nations Development Programme
(UNDP), among others, can start to provide technical assistance. The commission
has not yet been established, however, and MINUSTAH continued to encourage the
Transitional Government to do so as a matter of priority [DisarmamentDemobilization, Reintegration: Advocate].";Advocate;Advocate;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

towns and villages remained without a permanent military presence, although
occasional patrols were conducted [Operations_PatrolsInterventions: Implement]. The lack of a presence in some parts of the

assessment, as reporting was mainly restricted to the major population centres of
Port-au-Prince and areas in the north of the country.";;;;;;;;;;;;Implement;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
MINUSTAH_S/2004/698;11;844;"11. Since the arrival of MINUSTAH and the initiation of joint patrolling with the Haitian National Police, the security situation has improved gradually [Operations_PatrolsInterventions: Assist]. Armed
groups continue to control some parts of the country, however, in particular in the
north and the east along the border with the Dominican Republic, and claim to be
exercising official security and administrative functions in the absence of a
sufficiently strong HNP presence. In other instances, there have been reports of
former soldiers sharing offices and patrolling jointly with HNP in some localities.
Isolated instances of violence and gunfire, including killings, home invasions, acts
of retaliation, kidnappings, gang activity, confrontation between members of HNP
and former soldiers of the disbanded Haitian armed forces, vigilante justice and
general criminal acts continued to be reported. Armed groups involved in political
violence include street gangs, popular organizations that supported former President
Aristide, insurgents against the former President, members of the former military,
members of disbanded police units, and some organized criminal groups. On 8 July,
the Transitional Government’s Superior Council on the National Police (Conseil
supérieur de la Police nationale), composed of the Prime Minister, the Ministers of
Justice and the Interior, the Director General of HNP and the Inspector General in
Chief of HNP, issued a communiqué stating that the activities of armed groups
presenting themselves as security forces were illegal and that failure to desist from
such activities after 15 September 2004 would result in action being taken by the
Transitional Government, with the help of MINUSTAH.";;;;;;;;;;;;Assist;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

departure of the Mission at the end of November, the emphasis has shifted to the
training of trainers to prepare the Haitian National Police for the post-MIPONUH

UNMIH_S/1996/416;15;739;EDIT: The new leadership of HNP, under Mr. Robert Manuel, the Secretary of State for Public Security, and Mr. Pierre Denize, the new Director General of the Police, is working closely with the civilian police component of UNMIH. They have prepared an immediate and long-range work programme to promote the institutional development of HNP in four major areas: training, infrastructure and logistics, management, and operations [PoliceReform: AssistPolicies]. To ensure rapid progress, working groups including representatives of the Government, UNMIH and the Friends of the Secretary-General for Haiti have been set up in each area. President Preval, the Prime Minister and other senior officials are kept informed on a weekly basis of the progress achieved by these groups.;;;;;;;;;;AssistPolicies,Assist;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
UNMIH_S/1996/416;11;738;EDIT: The UNMIH civilian police component is deployed at 19 locations throughout Haiti. With the completion of the deployment of HNP, CIVPOL officers are focusing their efforts on helping HNP draw up an institutional development plan in the various joint working groups set up to ensure a smooth and orderly transfer of the tasks currently carried out by UNMIH (see S/1996/112, para. 37). (PoliceReform: AssistPolicies] CIVPOL are actively involved in the training of HNP and nine CIVPOL officers have been deployed at the Police Academy[PoliceReform: AssistAgents].

UNMIH_S/1996/416;10;737;EDIT: As mandated by the Security Council, and in keeping with the priorities established by the Government of Haiti, the UNMIH military component has continued to assist the Haitian authorities in their security tasks, such as ensuring an outer cordon of security and logistical support for President Preval during his travels around the country, as well as providing security to former President Aristide. It also provides a security presence at key installations, including the Port-au-Prince international airport and the seaport. Together with the Haitian National Police and CIVPOL, UNMIH military personnel patrol the capital [OperationsPatrolsIntervention: Assist], thereby maximizing the impact of the Mission's reduced resources and providing on-the-job training to HNP [PoliceReform: AssistAgents].

UNMIH_S/1996/112;48;736;EDIT: With the building up of the Haitian security forces and the gradual transfer of responsibilities to those forces, the level of assistance required will continue to decrease. For instance, specialized units, such as the Presidential Security Unit, the National Presidential and Residence Guard, the Ministerial Guard and the Court Security Unit, will require minimal assistance. It will soon be necessary to provide security for the former President, but the additional assistance needed by the Haitian authorities to meet this demand will also be minimal. Port and airport security is being handed over to Haitian security forces. Operations such as city patrolling or escorting humanitarian convoy are being gradually transferred to the Haitian National Police, so that UNMIH forces will serve mainly as back-up to the Haitian National Police and CIVPOL. Elections for territorial assemblies may be held during the next six months, in which case UNMIH could assist in maintaining an environment conducive to their free and fair conduct. With respect to the professionalization of the security forces, it will be recalled that FAd'H has been dismantled., UNMIH will continue to focus on training the new civilian Haitian National Police [PoliceReform: AssistAgents].;;;;;;;;;;Assist,AssistAgents;;;;;;;Implement,ProvideSecurity;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
UNMIH_S/1996/112;31;734;EDIT: Since April 1995, UNMIH has provided security to humanitarian convoys [HumanitarianRelief: ProvideSecurity], airports, seaports, storage locations and United Nations installations. With financial contributions from the Caisse française de développement and IDB, UNMIH engineering units have rebuilt the bridge in Jacmel that was washed away late in 1994 [StateAdministration: Implement with IA]. President Aristide participated in the opening of the new bridge on 15 December 1995. Contingents from Canada, the Netherlands and the United States have provided the stimulus for small development projects sponsored by their respective Governments, and other UNMIH contingents have also contributed to these activities. Overall, some 1,000 small projects, including training courses on disaster relief and prevention [HumanitarianRelief: Assist], were initiated by the Mission. As a result, conditions in rural communities have been improved, creating goodwill for UNMIH's contingents. The UNMIH Civil Affairs Unit is developing a plan for the completion of most of these projects prior to 15 February 1996. Responsibility for the completion of the remaining projects will be transferred to local communities or governmental and non-governmental agencies.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;Implement,InternationalActor;;;;;;;;;;;;Assist,ProvideSecurity;;;;
UNMIH_S/1996/112;30;733;EDIT: Since it took over responsibilities from the multinational force on 31 March 1995, UNMIH has assisted the Government of Haiti in sustaining a secure and stable environment and protecting international personnel and key installations. It established an environment conducive to the organization of free legislative [ElectoralSecurity: Implement], local and presidential elections and provided technical assistance for the entire electoral process [ElectionAssistance: Assist]. It has assisted with the creation if the Haitian National Police, providing much-needed on-the-job training and guidance to the new Haitian policemen in the field [PoliceReform: AssistAgents., AssistOther]. As the development of a cadre of competent supervisors both in the field and at the administrative level has lagged behind the training of basic-level policemen, CIVPOL has, since January 1996, focused on assistance in the organization of managerial components of the officers of the departmental commissioners and the major commissariats of the Haitian National Police, and hopes to begin leadership training for those occupying junior and senior management positions in the Haitian National Police. In addition, a number of CIVPOL officers with expertise in areas such as finance, computers, personnel, logistics and communications are being identified and will be seconded to Haitian National Police Headquarters.;;;;;;;;;;AssistAgents,AssistOther;;;;;;;;;;;;;Implement;Assist;;;;;;;;;;;;;
UNMIH_S/1996/112;15;732;EDIT: With respect to equipment, the United States, through ICITAP, has provided various items, including some vehicles, weapons and office furniture, while UNMIH, through the dedicated Trust Fund, has coordinated and supported the procurement of fire-fighting equipment, ambulances and other vehicles [StateAdministration: MaterialSupport], as well as other equipment to enable the Haitian National Police to discharge its duties [PoliceReform: MaterialSupport];;;;;;;;;;MaterialSupport;;;;;;;;;;;MaterialSupport;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
UNMIH_S/1996/112;14;731;EDIT: The most serious concern is the absence of competent senior officers and overall leadership. The impact of inadequate experience and leadership can be seen from a number of instances when Haitian National Police personnel have used unwarranted or disproportionate force, often resulting in incidents that could have been avoided. A case in point was the unneccessary use of a firearm by a Haitian National Police officers in the slum of Cité Soleil, which caused the accidental killing of a child on 23 November 1995 and resulted in riots and the burning of the police station by the enraged populace. The Haitian National Police did not re-enter the area for two weeks and the only security during that period was that provided by UNMIH patrols [OperationsPatrolsIntervention: Implement]. Lack of leadership also affected the discipline of the force, leading to incorrect behavior, which in turn undermines its authority, and respect for it. Senior management in the Haitian National Police itself and UNMIH members monitoring the force agree that [PoliceReform: Monitor], before they can reasonably be expected to manage things on their own, these young officers need the support that only the physical presence and guidance of experts and seasoned policemen can provide.;;;;;;;;;;Monitor;;Implement;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
UNMIH_S/1996/112;12;730;EDIT: It will be recalled that, under Security Council resolution 940 of 31 July 1994, UNMIH was mandated to assist the Government of Haiti in the creation of a police force. Pursuant to Council resolution 975 of 30 January 1995, a total of 847 United nations CIVPOL officers from 19 countries were deployed in 19 locations. While formal training of the new police is being carried out with the assistance of Canada, France and the United States in the Police Academy, run by the International Criminal Investigative Training Assistance Programe of the United States, UNMIH has worked closely with the Haitian authorities to provide on-the-job training and to give guidance to the new police officers now deployed throughout the country and monitor their performance [PoliceReform: AssistAgents., AssistOther., Monitor]. In addition, three CIVPOL officers were assigned to a 10-man Criminal Investigation Unit to investigate paricularly sensitive murder cases. Two Haitian National Police officers are attached to CIVPOL headquarters and are undergoing on-the-job training in administrative procedures, computer use and statistical work[PoliceReform: AssistAgents]. To enhance its training capacity and ensure closer cooperation, CIVPOL has moved into Haitian National Police stations at a number of locations such as Port-au-Prince, Arcahaie and Croix des Bouquets. UNMIH has instituted a programme to train 200 Haitian National Police drivers in an attempt to reduce the critically high accident rate and prevent further loss of vehicles recently acquired for the police.;;;;;;;;;;AssistAgents,Assist,Monitor,AssistOther;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
UNMIH_S/1996/112;7;729;EDIT: However, the security situation deteriorated abruptly in the wake of the attack on 7 November 1995 against two deputies, one of whom was killed and the other seriously injured. Violent demonstrations erupted in Les Cayes, Département du Sud, to which the two deputies belonged, necessitating the deployment of the Quick Reaction Force and joint Haitian National Police/UNMIH patrols for several days until the situation stabilized [OperationsPatrolsIntervention: Assist]. On 11 November, President Aristide, in highly emotional remarks at the funeral service for deputy Feuillé, called for immediate and total disarmament and accused the international community of complacency in this regard. Agitation quickly spread to other cities. Roadblocks were set up, and demonstrations, acts of arson, looting, weapons searchers and vigilante justice occured in various places throughout Haiti, especially Port-au-Prince, Gonaïves and Cap Haïtien. Confusion and fear reappeared and there were reports that members of the bourgeoisie and former members of the armed forces were hurriedly leaving the country. Following a meeting with president Aristide, my Special Representative appealed to the people on 13 November not to take the law into their own hands and the police, with the support of UNMIH, slowly re-established control. These incidents, which left at least seven people dead, many more injured and considerable property damage, brought home the fact that the security situation was still fragile.;;;;;;;;;;;;Assist;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
UNMIH_S/1996/112;3;728;EDIT: The timely holding of the presidential election was a significant step in the consolidation of constitutional order in Haiti. Learning from the experience it had gained from the flaws in the organization of legislative and local elections, the Provisional Electoral Council made elaborate preparations. Fourteen candidates participated in the election. Of the main parties that had boycotted the second round of legislative elections, only one took part in the contest despite its initial doubts over the impartiality of the electoral apparatus. The Provisional Electoral Council maintained a regular dialogue both with the candidates, in order to address their concerns, and with the media, in order to ensure a continuous flow of election-related information. As a result, the Provisional Electoral Council was widely credited with having improved the openness and transparency in the electoral process. In accordance with its mandate, UNMIH provided extensive technical assistance to the Provisional Electoral Council in preparing for the election [ElectionAssistance: Assist], as well as the necessary logistical support [ElectionAssistance: MaterialSupport]. Material required for registration and polling was distributed and collected throughout the country with the help of UNMIH.

UNMIH_S/1995/922;29;727;EDIT: The Ministry of Justice has appointed personnel for the recently created National Penitentiary Administration, some 420 members of which underwent an initial two-week training with assistance from UNDP and MICIVIH and have assumed responsibility for the country's penitentiaries. MICIVIH and the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) have assisted in establishing a system of prisoner registration which, in addition to improving the protection of prisoners' rights, allows for an exact assessment of the prison population. Most detainees are now brought before a judge within the legal time-frame. In collaboration with UNDP, UNMIH, MICIVIH and international donors, the Natoinal Penitentiary Administration has considerably improved the basic living condition of prisoners [PrisonReform: MaterialSupport with IA]. There are sanitary and medical services in 8 of 15 prisons, including the National Penitentiary. The situation remains critical, however, in a number of prisons, where overcrowding and inadequate infrastructure undermine security and living conditions. The Civil Affairs Unit of UNMIH is currently rehabilitating the Cap Haitien prison under a project funded by multilateral agencies [PrisonReform: Implement].

The UNMIH Electoral Assistance Team provided technical expertise to the Provisional Electoral Council for the preparation of these elections at both the national and the departmental levels. Its assistance covered areas such as logistical planning, organization and coordination, establishment of budget estimates, preparation of instructions to departmental and communal electoral authorities, polling and counting. UNMIH's military and CIVPOL components assisted the Haitian police in ensuring security throughout the electoral period, including the transport of ballots before and after the vote [ElectoralSecurity: Assist].

They are being trained on-the-job by CIVPOL monitors [PoliceReform: AssistAgents], who are constantly monitoring their progress and performance [PoliceReform: Monitor]. However, the Haitian National Police still lacks an experienced and skilled leadership, a area of concern that needs to be addressed by the Haitian Government.

ONUSAL_S/1995/220;25;698;EDIT: Several other matters require attention. A campaign to promote civilian admissions into the Academy appears to have yielded only moderate results and is being reviewed by ONUSAL [PoliceReform: Monitor]. The Government has requested that, as an exception to a provision in the 19 May 1994 Timetable, five former National Police officers be accepted as Academy candidates. FMLN has not agreed to this. The criteria and procedures for admission to the Academy should thus be reviewed and strenghtened to improve the selection of candidates. The Academic Council's decision to intensify basic-level courses and to extend their duration from six to eight months should be put into effect. Of particular importance is the acceleration of training and specialized agents and officers, especially in the areas of criminal investigations, transit, public security and finance. Criminal investigations deserve special attention since professional quality, coupled with effective coordination with the Attorney-General's office and the judiciary, is the key element to combat crime and eradicate impunity;;;;;;;;;;Monitor;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

The corresponding strength on 1 June 1994 was 201. Despite this reduction, the Police Division has continued to verify the performance [PoliceReform: Monitor] and demobilization of the National Police [DisarmamentDemobilization: Monitor] and the training, deployment and operations of the National Civil Police.

While a limited number of registered arms are still to be collected, the main problem lies with the unknown but large number of weapons of which there is no record.

ONUSAL_S/1995/220;10;692;EDIT: While these institutional reforms were undertaken by the Government, resistance to change persisted. Thus, notwithstanding the dissolution of the military intelligence apparatus, the Joint Group for the Investigation of Politically Motivated Illegal Armed Groups, set up in December 1993, found that active members of the Armed Forces were in all likelihood still involved in internal intelligence activities [MilitaryReform: Monitor]. Although ONUSAL has found no evidence that this is an institutional policy, the possible use of this information-gathering capacity fo political or common crimes is a matter of serious concern [MilitaryReform: Monitor].

ensure that the settlements can be easily and quickly transferred [Reintegration: Advocate]. Such
flexibility is called for because strict interpretation of the rules of the

for such positions, due account being taken of their professional merits [PoliceReform: Advocate].
ONUSAL has also noted that the supervision of the more than 2,000 students at
the Academy requires an increased number of monitors, in respect of whose

Moreover, given that frequent changes in
command positions in the National Civil Police have affected efficiency, a system should be established to ensure continuity of service while providing more stable working conditions. In this regard, the prompt approval of a law
regulating the police career would be essential.";;;;;;;;;;Advocate;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

assigned. ONUSAL has recommended that members of both divisions be evaluated in
order to determine their provisional ranks and that they enrol in regular
courses at the Academy at the appropriate levels [PoliceReform: Advocate]. This will help to correct the
existing anomalies and will facilitate the integration of both divisions into
the National Civil Police.";;;;;;;;;;Advocate;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Division limit its activities to that area and adjust its structure accordingly [PoliceReform: Advocate].
It has also recommended that personnel incorporated into the former Special
Anti-narcotics Unit after the complementary agreement of 22 December 1992 (which
allowed members of the unit to enter the National Civil Police on an exceptional

of the Armed Forces of El Salvador and FMLN, as well as supporters of the latter
who became landholders in the former zones of conflict [Reintegration: Assist with IA]. The many problems
besetting these programmes were analysed in some detail in my last report.
Administrative problems, financial constraints and lack of full cooperation

contributed in different degrees to serious delays.";;InternationalActor,Assist;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ONUSAL_S/1994/561;74;661;"The second phase of the Acceleration Plan has raised new problems by
contemplating the issue by the Land Bank of credit certificates to potential
beneficiaries. The latter would then negotiate terms for purchase of the land
directly with landowners. FMLN has objected to the fact that these certificates
have an expiry date (30 April 1995). Given past problems with land transfers
and the fear that these might now worsen (since FMLN beneficiaries will be
negotiating directly with the landowner without much technical assistance), the
possibility that beneficiaries’ entitlement might expire at a fixed date would
be most disturbing. ONUSAL has reported the reaching of an understanding that
the certificates could be renewed upon expiry [Reintegration: Monitor]. Justifiable concerns would be
alleviated further and compliance with the 13 October programme restored if this
understanding were to be made explicit in the certificates.";;Monitor;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

agreement that they would be dealt with at the end of the programme, as accepted
by FMLN on 8 September 1993. However, the impossibility of proceeding with the
transfer of properties containing non-verified landholders has again brought the
programme to a virtual standstill. In search of a solution, my Special
Representative has been meeting with government officials and representatives of
major donor countries to find ways to finance the early transfer of land to
non-verified landholders [Reintegration: Meeting, *land transfer is meant for ex-combatants' reintegration to civilian life. land transfer to non-verified landholders is part of the larger effort]. I am glad to report that, in its letter dated
5 May 1994, the Government has informed my Special Representative that financing

ONUSAL_S/1994/561;44;656;"EDIT: Between October and December 1993, the National Police demobilized 900 agents. In January 1994, the Government announced the suspension of demobilization but subsequently informed ONUSAL of the demobilization of a
further 900 agents between January and March. ONUSAL has requested an explanation of this apparent contradiction. Thus far, only around 10 per cent of all demobilized personnel have registered for reintegration programmes (see para. 46). According to the Government’s phasing-out plan, a further 5,900
agents and over 1,000 administrative personnel currently deployed in four departments and parts of three other departments will have to be discharged before the 31 October 1994 deadline established by the Accords. ONUSAL has continued to urge the Government to accelerate the reduction of the National Police and to bring its phasing-out into line with the deployment rate of the
National Civil Police [PoliceReform: Advocate].";;;;;;;;;;Advocate;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ONUSAL_S/1994/561;42;655;"EDIT: ONUSAL has detected the following four main weaknesses in the functioning
of the National Civil Police [PoliceReform: Monitor]:
(a) There is an absence of clear guidelines and criteria regarding legal and police procedures, a problem that is compounded by deficiencies in the legal instruction received at the Academy. The unit for control of the National Civil Police should play an important role in providing such guidelines and supervising their implementation.,

(b) There is insufficient coordination between the police and the Academy. One way to improve this could be to set up a permanent coordinating mechanism between the two institutions. The forthcoming evaluation of National Civil Police members by the Academy should be useful in bringing both institutions
closer.,

(c) There is a lack of coordination in the activities of the police, the judiciary, the Attorney-General’s Office and the National Counsel for the Defence of Human Rights [PoliceReform: Monitor., JusticeReform: Monitor., HumanRights: Monitor]. The fight against crime and the simultaneous strengthening of democratic institutions can only be successful if there is a joint inter-institutional effort.,

(d) In September 1993, in what can only be termed a self-defeating move, the Government did not request the extension of the technical assistance that ONUSAL had provided to the National Civil Police since April (see S/26790,
para. 19), thereby depriving the new police of valuable support. Since then, in contrast to the welcome initially given to the new corps by the population, complaints of human rights violations by the National Civil Police have
increased. In addition, both the Police and Human Rights Divisions of ONUSAL
have faced serious difficulties in carrying out their verification activities as police units have been instructed not to cooperate with ONUSAL [PoliceReform, HumanRights: Monitor].";;;;;;;Monitor;;;Monitor;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ONUSAL_S/1994/561;40;654;"The Director-General has now appointed the heads of the units on
disciplinary investigation and control and the former unit has been operational
for two months. ONUSAL, however, has received complaints that the National
Civil Police has failed to take forceful action and to cooperate with the
judiciary when its agents are reported to have been involved in unlawful
behaviour. The Director-General of the National Civil Police has been meeting
with the heads of the two units, in the presence of ONUSAL, with a view to
correcting this situation [PoliceReform: Meeting]. The control unit has yet to be provided with the
human and material resources and legal framework that will permit it to begin
the important task of supervising all police services.";;;;;;;;;;Meeting;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ONUSAL_S/1994/561;34;652;"The Committee also stated that former 
members of the Special Antinarcotics Unit and the Criminal Investigation Commission could join only the Antinarcotics and the Criminal Investigations Divisions of the National Civil Police and could not be assigned to duties outside those divisions until after December 1994. For its part, ONUSAL has made it clear that the officers of those units can at no time hold command positions in other divisions or in the departmental delegations of the National Civil Police without undergoing the regular Academy courses for officers [PoliceReform: Advocate]. Furthermore, the Committee recommended that the Government start to train Academy graduates in antinarcotics and criminal investigation so as to incorporate them into the corresponding divisions of the National Civil Police. ONUSAL has recently ascertained that many of the former sergeants of the Special Antinarcotics Unit enrolled in the National Civil Police as sub-inspectors are now responsible for criminal investigations in a
number of delegations of the National Civil Police, instead of working in their area of specialist expertise [PoliceReform: Monitor].";;;;;;;;;;Monitor,Advocate;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

composed of the Directors-General of the National Civil Police and the Academy and the United States technical adviser to the National Civil Police [PoliceReform: AssistOther with IA]. An ONUSAL representative participated in the Committee as a verifier [PoliceReform: Monitor]. On 10 February 1994, the Committee decided that the Government should provide a
complete list of the candidates for incorporation into both units, indicating whether or not they had attended the special Academy course, and the marks obtained in the psychotechnical and conceptual examinations, which they had
taken on the recommendation of ONUSAL. Only those candidates who had attended the special course and passed the examinations could be accepted into the National Civil Police. ONUSAL has not yet received that list.";;;;;;;;;;Assist,AssistOther,InternationalActor,Monitor;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

these divisions. Although close to 250 agents have already undergone
specialized training in traffic control and finance, both divisions are far from
being fully operational. While members of the former are currently receiving
additional training from ONUSAL (see para. 21), the Finance Division only
deployed its first contingent on 11 May, over five months behind schedule [PoliceReform: AssistAgents]. The
deployment of the Finance Division must be accelerated as the Division should
gradually replace the Customs Police, which is due to be demobilized on
31 October 1994 at the latest (see para. 45). The training of members of the
Border Division has begun belatedly, given that its deployment should have
started in early April., and the training of members of the Arms and Explosives

observed that the training programme prepared by the Tribunal had had uneven
success [ElectionAssistance: Monitor]. Save in the Department of Chalatenango, attendance at the Tribunal’s

those parties decided to train their own representatives separately.";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;Monitor;;;;;;;;;;;;;

posted observers in the five areas of work which the contending parties and the
Supreme Electoral Tribunal designated as most important: registration,
computation, printing, electoral project unit and training [ElectionAssistance: Monitor]. It was noted that
the printing of the ballot papers was carried out in the presence of
representatives of the parties and of ONUSAL, save for the first tens of
thousands which were the results of trial runs and were unnumbered [ElectionAssistance: Monitor]. No numbered

ONUSAL_S/1994/375;26;627;"In general, the Assembly and municipal elections were conducted under the
same conditions as the presidential election. The foregoing remarks therefore
remain valid in general. However, the smaller size of constituencies at this
electoral level means that problems affecting a small number of votes can have a
significant impact on the outcome and give rise to challenges such as those
mentioned earlier. Such challenges will be dealt with in the manner laid down
by the legislation, and ONUSAL will continue to observe how cases evolve until
definitive solutions are found [ElectionAssistance: Monitor]. There is no reason why local challenges should
affect the overall validity of the electoral process.";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;Monitor;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ONUSAL_S/1994/375;25;626;"However, the irregularities noted must not be mistaken for significant
manipulation of the election by means of fraudulent interference with its
essential components, such as ballot boxes, ballot papers and tally sheets. In
fact, where the presidential election is concerned, no party has rejected the
results and the ONUSAL observers did not record any fraudulent acts that could
have a significant impact on the outcome [ElectionAssistance: Monitor]. Moreover, the fact that the
provisional count by the Supreme Electoral Tribunal, the quick count by ONUSAL [ElectionAssistance: Monitor],
the count by the principal political parties and the voting trends identified by
pre-electoral surveys all basically tally with one another constitutes an
additional technical element confirming that there was no significant
manipulation of the election.";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;Monitor;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ONUSAL_S/1994/375;16;625;"Since there is soon to be a second round for the presidential election, the
anomalies recorded in the first round should be eliminated, in the light of the
experience gained by the Supreme Electoral Tribunal from the process that took
place on Sunday, 20 March. In a letter dated 24 March to the Supreme Electoral
Tribunal ONUSAL expressed its views regarding what measures could be taken prior
to the second round in order to deal with the shortcomings identified [ElectionAssistance: Advocate].";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;Advocate;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ONUSAL_S/1994/375;14;624;"EDIT: In addition, many citizens with voter cards were unable to vote, because their names were not on the list, save for those voters who were able to vote at the specially equipped tables in the municipalities of Zacamil, Soyapango and
Nueva Guadalupe. ONUSAL estimates that over 25,000 people, i.e. nearly 2 per cent of the electorate, were thus affected [ElectionAssistance: Monitor]. There were also citizens who were unable to vote because others had used their names to vote. ONUSAL has determined that a very small number was involved. It is regrettable that despite the strenuous efforts to register new voters made by ONUSAL, the donor countries and non-governmental organizations, the Supreme Electoral Tribunal failed to produce a more adequate electoral roll [ElectionAssistance: Implement with IA ].";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;Monitor,Implement,InternationalActor;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ONUSAL_S/1994/375;12;623;"Up to the night before the elections, there had still been no solution to
the problem of the four municipalities of Chalatenango (Arcatao, San José
Las Flores, San Isidro Labrador and Nueva Trinidad) from which the Supreme
Electoral Tribunal had decided that voting should be moved to the departmental
capital, citing security considerations and the scarce population, which were
described as reasons of force majeure. On the night of 19 March, the Tribunal
ruled that the election for each of these municipalities would be held
simultaneously at two locations, the municipality itself and the capital of the
department. All the parties accepted this ruling. Voting took place normally,
and the votes were counted in the city of Chalatenango, to which the ballot
boxes from the four municipalities were transported. ONUSAL observers
accompanied the materials being delivered, and were in attendance when the
elections were conducted and when the votes were counted [ElectionAssistance: Monitor].

such electoral agencies as the Monitoring Board, the departmental electoral boards, the municipal electoral boards and the polling station teams. ONUSAL observers noted the presence of monitors from the main political parties at all polling stations, and noted no interference with their work [ElectionAssistance: Monitor.,  PartyAssistance: Monitor]. This massive presence of monitors and the ease with which they were able to convey their concerns to ONUSAL observers made it difficult for serious irregularities to
occur without being documented on the forms which the observers completed for each polling station. Only eight reports of serious incidents were received, none of them of such a nature or on such a scale as to make the problem
intractable or to have a significant effect on the results of the election. The most serious incidents had to do with the large number of voters with voter cards whose names were not on the register. This happened in two municipalities of San Salvador (Zacamil and Soyapango) and in one municipality of San Miguel (Nueva Guadalupe). In these three cases, the interim solution was to prepare a special ballot box for those voters [ElectionAssistance: Implement].

15 hours from the time the polling stations were set up to the completion of the

to resolve countless practical problems of organization of the voting [ElectionAssistance: Assist]. A team
of 40 specialized observers is currently monitoring the official count of the
votes in the Supreme Electoral Tribunal. The observers collected information on
the events of election day on more than 7,000 forms (one for each of the 6,984

ONUSAL_S/1994/375;3;619;"In order to provide the population quickly with information regarding the
election results, the Supreme Electoral Tribunal organized a provisional count
of the votes. The system was based on transporting a copy of the tally sheets
from the polling stations directly to San Salvador by car and helicopter. The
tally sheets were processed at the operations centre set up for that purpose by
a specialized company which had recently carried out the same type of work in
other countries in the region. The system was tried out on four successive
Sundays and, during the last two trials, the coverage was 100 per cent and
success complete. However, the actual operation of the system appears to have
presented difficulties since, three days after the polls closed, the provisional
count was still not complete. The greatest difficulty was found in transporting
the data to the place where the count was being taken, since there were no
problems with the computing system. The provisional count was suspended on
Wednesday, 23 March, when some 82 per cent of the votes had been computed. On
the basis of these data, the results of the presidential election published by
the Tribunal are as follows: Alianza Republicana Nacionalista (ARENA)
49.26 per cent., Movimiento Nacional Revolucionario (MNR) - Convergencia
Democrática (CD) - Frente Farabundo Martí para la Liberación Nacional (FMLN)
coalition 25.29 per cent., Partido Demócrata Cristiano (PDC) 16.01 per cent.,

Communication with the Tribunal included not only complaints presented to ONUSAL by claimants from different sources, mostly political parties, but also reports on problems identified in the field by ONUSAL observers [ElectionAssistance: Monitor]. These communications covered most of the issues subject to public discussion. In some cases, they were solved by action from the Tribunal. In this connection, ONUSAL made recommendations to the Tribunal as appropriate [ElectionAssistance: Advocate].
Some 300 complaints were presented to ONUSAL during the campaign period, most of them (23 per cent) dealing with arbitrary or illegitimate action by public authorities.

ONUSAL [PartyAssistance: Monitor., Media: Monitor]. All the parties are present in most media, although with different intensity. ARENA has consistently taken the lead in advertising time, on both radio and television, followed closely by the Christian Democratic Party, and at a further distance by the CD/MNR/FMLN coalition and other parties. As for the content of political advertising, it has been found to be generally congenial to the prescriptions of electoral legislation. Nevertheless, the Electoral Division of ONUSAL has received a number of complaints from different political
parties regarding the use of public resources to promote indirectly the governing party. In addition, although there is a ban on publicity of
government programmes 30 days prior to the elections, in monitoring the media the Electoral Division itself has ascertained that several ministries and governmental agencies were advertising their own programmes up to the time of the drafting of the present report [ElectionAssistance: Monitor., Media: Monitor].";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;Monitor;;Monitor;;;;;;;;;

Despite the absence of security forces at two thirds of the events, only a few serious incidents have occurred [ElectoralSecurity: Monitor]. Although some persons were seriously injured, no fatalities have been reported from campaign activities. Approximately 34 per cent of events monitored by ONUSAL were organized by the

their registration card was not available even after all cards had been sent to
the field [ElectionAssistance: Monitor]. There were also citizens who had a voter card, but whose names did
not appear on the list of the municipality where they had chosen to vote. While
at least some of these cases may have been corrected by the Tribunal in response
to claimants, the extent of the problem could not be quantified and difficulties
may arise on election day.";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;Monitor;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ONUSAL_S/1994/304;9;613;"A way to solve the problem of the remaining non-validated applications was
provided for in articles 30, 48 and 51 of the Electoral Code, whereby
corrections and claims may be made with regard to the Register during a time
period to be established by the Supreme Electoral Tribunal. In practice,
although the Tribunal issued instructions on this matter via the media, it
failed to include specific deadlines for citizens to submit complaints. During
the last days of February and up to 6 March, ONUSAL teams observed that requests
for corrections and submission of birth certificates for the validation of voter
applications were being accepted by the Tribunal [ElectionAssistance: Monitor]. Approximately 5,000 claims of
citizens who did not have a voting card owing to the lack of a birth certificate
were processed by the Tribunal.";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;Monitor;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ONUSAL_S/1994/304;8;612;"One major flaw of the Register is that over 74,000 persons requesting
registration have not been included because their application could not be
validated by a birth certificate. At the national level, that figure amounts to
2.8 per cent of the entire register of voters. Nevertheless, there are 35
municipalities in former conflict zones where the average of non-validated
applications amounts to 10.4 per cent, more than triple the national average.
In absolute terms, the number of those applications translates to over 10,000.
This occurred in spite of the fact that 2 extensive plans for the recovery of
more than 360,000 birth certificates from municipal offices were implemented
with the assistance of ONUSAL and the United States Agency for International
Development (USAID), concentrating more intensively in the former conflict
zones [ElectionAssistance: Assist with IA]. Nearly 60,000 applications for registration were validated on the
results of those plans. Since destruction of registers was particularly

certificates to validate some 60,000 requests for registration, with another

that most of these requests would require a more detailed and time-consuming
effort at validation owing to problems, inter alia, in identifying the place and
date of birth and relating to the nature and order of names and surnames of the
individuals concerned. El Salvador has no civil registry per se, and the
relevant legislation affords great latitude in the use of surnames. These
factors are compounded by distortions, both of a physical nature and in the
identification of birth places, caused by migration from rural areas to towns
and displacements caused by the armed conflict. One legal way of validating the
requests that were rejected when registration was closed remains open, and the
citizens concerned may make use of it until 19 February 1994, when the final
rolls are to be issued: articles 51 and 48 of the Electoral Code, and the
Supreme Electoral Tribunal has upheld this in joint meetings with ONUSAL, the

election campaign. Following the closure of voter registration on 19 January 1994 and the drawing up of the provisional electoral rolls, major improvement in registration conditions has been observed. Here the work done by
the Tribunal must be acknowledged, both in making its procedures more flexible and in remaining open to criticism and to suggestions from the Board of Vigilance, the political parties and the foreign agencies providing support for
the electoral process. In addition, owing to the strategic and logistical support from the Electoral Division [ElectionAssistance: Assist., MaterialSupport], with the help of the other components of ONUSAL, the joint efforts of various agencies and individuals resulted in a

democratic societies. I acknowledge the complexity of establishing a completely
new police force and transferring responsibility for public order to it in the
aftermath of a long civil war and in the middle of a crime wave. But ONUSAL’s

a lack of commitment to the objective enshrined in the Peace Accords [PoliceReform: Monitor]. This is
reflected in the denial to the National Civil Police of the necessary logistical

the prolongation of the existence of the National Police and the denial to

questioned the way the verification was made. For example, the verification as
reflected in the Commission’s records often included the names of those on the
board of a cooperative but not all of its members, although they had filled out
forms for verification purposes (boletas). Thus the Commission’s verification
underestimated the total number of potential beneficiaries. In the Follow-up

boletas would also be included [Reintegration: Assist]. These, however, had not been accepted at the

The subsequent killings of two senior FMLN leaders, a member of the governing party (ARENA) and two former municipal officials belonging to that party, brought this issue into sharper focus. In view of these killings and the ONUSAL position as expressed by its Human Rights Division, the Government created an
Interinstitutional Commission to investigate this type of crimes. At a meeting between the President and the FMLN leadership (with ONUSAL present), it was decided to invite foreign experts to cooperate in the investigation of the cases of the two senior FMLN leaders [HumanRights: Meeting., PartyAssistance: Meeting]. This led to the creation of a subgroup of the Commission, the Interinstitutional Investigation Group for that purpose. On 29 October, ONUSAL informed the Government that the Interinstitutional

some 700,000 people - do not have an electoral card [ElectionAssistance: Monitor with IA]. Failure to register is
commonest in those departments which experienced the highest levels of armed
conflict in the past. Nevertheless, the failure to register would appear to be

However, according to information received by ONUSAL, the Secretariat has to date disbursed funds for only a small number of the projects requested [StateAdministration: Monitor]. ONUSAL expects the Government to take urgent
steps to accelerate the feasibility studies for these projects and their financing, as delays are creating resentment and frustration among those who have helped to reconcile the communities most divided by the war but are unable to initiate reconstruction for lack of support.";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;Monitor;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ONUSAL_S/25812;80;543;"EDIT: An advance of special significance is that public administration has now been fully restored in the former zones of conflict. As the members of the Council will recall, this process took place in two stages. When the Peace
Agreement was signed, 68 of the 262 mayors of El Salvador were away from their jurisdictions. Soon after the signing of the Agreement, 24 of them returned to these and were followed soon afterwards by almost the same number of judges. Opposition by local community organizations to the return of the remainder of the mayors and resistance by the latter to negotiating with the former on a
framework for their return effectively halted the process. Under arrangements subsequently negotiated by ONUSAL, 42 of the 44 mayors returned to their jurisdictions by mid-February 1993 [StateAdministration: Assist]. Similarly, most of the judges have also returned, with the exception of a few who have been unable to do so for lack of adequate premises in which to carry out their functions.";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;Assist;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

violations - some of them systematic - that still persist [HumanRights: Monitor]. In his sixth report, the Director of the Human Rights Division reiterated recommendations made in his previous reports and added 22 new recommendations [HumanRights: Advocate].

ONUSAL_S/25812;45;537;"As pointed out in the sixth report of the Director of the ONUSAL Human
Rights Division (S/25521, annex), a factual analysis of respect for human rights
in El Salvador reveals a gradual improvement, particularly when compared with
that prevailing before the signing of the peace accords [HumanRights: Monitor]. Evidence of that
improvement is the fact that not a single case of forced disappearance or
torture was recorded during the reporting period (June 1992-January 1993).
However, serious violations still persist with regard to the right to life,
personal integrity and liberty. The gravity of these violations is underscored
by their frequency and gruesome nature. They take place against a background of
public insecurity generated by common crime and a high murder rate.

ONUSAL_S/25812;43;536;"EDIT: One of the avenues open to members of the National Police is that of joining PNC through the Academy. On 17 June 1992, the Government and FMLN agreed that up to 20 per cent of the vacancies could be filled by serving National Police and FMLN ex-combatants, in order to maintain a balance between candidates from both sources. It was envisaged that these candidates would be
carefully screened. However, during the last admission examination, ONUSAL ascertained that a large number of National Police candidates had left that force four to six years ago, in many cases after being dismissed for
disciplinary reasons, and had only rejoined after the Peace Agreement was signed [PoliceReform: Monitor]. This is clearly not what was intended in the Peace Agreement and is especially disturbing when linked to the apparent reinforcement, rather than reduction, of the National Police.";;;;;;;;;;Monitor;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ONUSAL_S/25812;41;535;"EDIT: This situation results in a contradiction. The National Police was meant to be phased out gradually as the National Civil Police was deployed. Instead, it has increased significantly, not only as a result of these transfers, but also through the monthly graduation of some 60 to 100 police officers from the National Police training school which, ONUSAL recently found out, continues to
operate [PoliceReform: Monitor]. ONUSAL has been informed by the Government that the members of the National Police already replaced by PNC will be redeployed to areas of the country with higher crime rates. While the Agreement did not expressly establish that the reduction of the National Police should be synchronized with the deployment of PNC, it did state very clearly that the new police force
should replace the old one. For this reason, it is necessary that, at a minimum, the Government respond to ONUSAL’s request for its plan for the reduction of the National Police and, in that connection, that it inform ONUSAL
of its plans for the closing of the National 
Police training school [PoliceReform: Advocate]. The Government should also inform the Mission about its plans to dissolve certain police structures, mainly the Batallón Fiscal (the former Customs Police), whose
continued existence is evidently incompatible with that of the Finance Division of the National Civil Police.";;;;;;;;;;Monitor,Advocate;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

signing of the Peace Agreement on 16 January 1992. This was done despite ONUSAL
objections that this action contravened the Accords and subsequent undertakings
by the Government. After undergoing four months of training abroad, these candidates joined the PNC as provisional commands (mandos provisionales). ONUSAL has held several discussions with the Government on this subject and has recommended that the admission of these officers be deemed exceptional so that it will not create a precedent [PoliceReform: Meeting.,  Reintegration: Meeting].

inventory does not include all the weapons that were distributed by FAES during
the years of conflict. The Government has given various explanations for the
delay in implementation, but these do not lessen the seriousness of
non-compliance which engenders a sense of insecurity in the population and may
even be a factor in the high level of crime in the country (see para. 44). The
assurances given by the Government and FAES that they genuinely wish to move
ahead on this subject must be translated into more energetic measures that will
permit the full implementation of this part of the Agreement as soon as

ONUSAL_S/25812;15;523;"Following the formal end of the armed conflict, the Division closed its 15 verification centres, 6 of which were transferred to the Police Division for use by the Auxiliary Transitory Police (see para. 38). That same day saw the final
demobilization and incorporation into civilian life of the remaining FMLN ex-combatants, although the destruction of their arms, which at that time stood at 65 per cent of the inventory presented by FMLN, was delayed in some
verification centres since FMLN conditioned their destruction on the implementation of complementary commitments undertaken by the Government. Subsequently, the gradual destruction of conventional and sophisticated FMLN weapons, which were concentrated in El Salvador under ONUSAL control, as well as that of weapons deposited outside the country, resumed under ONUSAL’s verification [DisarmamentDemobilization: Monitor]. By 11 February, all the arms stored in the FMLN concentration areas had been destroyed and on 1 April the destruction of arms in deposits
outside El Salvador was completed. Thus effectively the arms listed in the FMLN
inventory presented to ONUSAL have been destroyed, except for a small quantity
of individual weapons - about 3.5 per cent of the total - which were reported
lost or stolen before their scheduled destruction. ONUSAL now has in its
custody a very small number of sophisticated FMLN weapons, the destruction of
which FMLN had scheduled to coincide with full compliance by the Government with
the recommendations of the Ad Hoc Commission, due at the end of June. This
arrangement has been understood and accepted by the Government. The Military

which remains under the command of Brigadier-General Victor Suanzes Pardo until
31 May 1993, has continued to verify the remaining aspects of the cease-fire

Armed Forces of El Salvador (FAES) [DisarmamentDemobilization: Monitor]. It also monitors the recovery of military
weapons held by private individuals, the introduction of the new armed forces
reserve system and relevant aspects of other pending commitments under the armed

territory, particularly in the former zones of conflict and through the deployment and patrols of its military observer groups [Operations_PatrolsInterventions: Implement]. The Division has also facilitated meetings between the teams involved in the Plan for the Prevention of Accidents from Mines (Plan de Prevención de Accidentes de Minas) and monitors its execution (see para. 22) [Demining: Monitor., Assist].

Public Security in February 1993. Further, at the Government’s request, ONUSAL
has taken on the additional task of providing professional assistance to the
National Civil Police [PoliceReform: AssistOther]. Given the considerable delays in these areas, an
extraordinary effort will have to be made to ensure substantial advances before
the general elections of March 1994. As was evident during the last World Bank
Consultative Group meeting in April this year (see section X), the main

Both COPAZ and the Legislative Assembly had made a determined effort to complete pending legislation. Informal reports on progress in recent weeks had been presented to the members of the Security Council. The following points are worth special mention:

(a) Demobilization and demilitarization
The demobilization of the fourth FMLN contingent, due on 20 November, was completed after considerable delay. However, the fifth and final contingent was demobilized on time. The relevant statistics are at Annex II.

(b) FMLN arms
The inventory was presented and the FMLN's arms concentrated in the designated zones on time by 30 November. After analysis by ONUSAL, the inventory was accepted as satisfactory [DisarmamentDemobilization: Monitor]. It included details both of sophisticated weapons and of armament located outside El Salvador. The destruction of the arms by FMLN began with only a slight delay. However, for technical reasons, destruction could not be completed by 15 December, by when only 50 per cent of the inventory had been destroyed. The process continues under ONUSAL's supervision and should finish by the end of December [DisarmamentDemobilization: Monitor]. The destruction of weapons located outside El Salvador should be completed in early January 1993.

(c) Recall of weapons distributed to civilian groups and indiiduals
This recall was to have been effected by 8 December 1992. However, notwithstanding constant urgings by ONUSAL, the Government failed to take any effective steps to ensure the return of the weapons [ControlSALW: Advocate]. As of 8 December 1992, less than 100 (out of an estimated total of several thousands) had been recovered. ONUSAL has been assured by the Government that its efforts will be intensified.

It has been functioning with a staff of 51 civilian professionals and 14 police observers. It was decided that the work of ONUSAL in relation to the San Jose Agreement would be the subject of a separate series of reports. The Director of the Human RIghts Division has submitted five reports covering the period from 26 July 1991 to 30 June 1992 (A/45/1055-S/23037 of 16 September 1991., A/46/658-S/23222 and Corr.1, of 15 November 1992., and A/46/876-S/23580 of 19 February 1992., A/46/935-S/24066 of 5 June 1992., and A/46/955-S/24375 of 12 August 1992). The last report of the Human Rights Division offers an assessment of the situation regarding those human rights whose verification was given priority in the San Jose Agreement, taking as a starting point the situation in El Salvador in July 1991 and highlighting the course of current events [HumanRights: Monitor]. In that report, the Director of the Human RIghts Division stated that, following the cease-fire on 1 February 1992, substantial improvements were recorded with regard to rights linked to humanitarian law, as well as to other rights related to the right to life, personal liberty and personal integrity [HumanRights: Monitor].

The Government continues to insist that it is entitled to effect such transfers of trained personnel in order to cope with the increase in crime, especially in the rural areas where the former National Guard and Treasury Police used to function. In this situation and in order to minimize the negative effects of such transfers, ONUSAL has insisted that they be on an individual basis, and not in units or sub-units, as this would amount to a redeployment of army personnel [Reintegration: Monitor., PoliceReform: Advocacy].

It has been agreed that candidates from FMLN and the National Police will each constitute 20 per cent of the intake. As I have reported to the Council (see S/23999, para. 29), the Government had undertaken not to present former members of the Treasury Police and the National Guard as candidates in the immediate future. However, several candidates from the National Police who recently applied for the senior and executive levels were found to have belonged to the National Guard, the Treasury Police or FAES before being transferred to the National Police after signature of the agreement of 16 January 1992. The Academic Council has decided to accept these candidates despite ONUSAL's objections that this contravenes the accords and subsequent undertakings by the Government [Reintegration/PoliceReform: Advocacy].

ONUSAL_S/24833;28;488;EDIT: Although the new State Intelligence Agency was constituted on 28 April 1992, six weeks behind schedule, and the appointment of its director was three months late, the former National Intelligence Department was disbanded by a general order of the Ministry of Defence on 9 June 1992, a few days ahead of schedule. The Military Division has verified that the Department has officially been disbanded, that its facilities have been handed over to other units of FAES, that its military personnel have been transferred to other units and that some civilian personnel have also been relocated in the FAES civilian administration [MilitaryReform: Monitor]. However, FMLN has expressed concern that FAES continues to undertake intelligence activities related to the internal situation in El Salvador. ONUSAL has not been able to establish clearly what functions the transferred personnel are performing in their new posts and, despite repeated requests, the location of the records of the former Department has not been divulged [MilitaryReform: Monitor].

ONUSAL_S/24833;24;486;EDIT: On 6 July 1992, the Joint Chiefs of Staff of FAES submitted a revised force reduction plan to ONUSAL. To date, two immediate reaction infantry battalions (Bracamonte and Belloso) have been dismantled. Information was requested on the location of their demobilized personnel after it was ascertained that former personnel of the Belloso Battalion had been recruited by the National Police [DisarmamentDemobilization: Monitor]. This development and its possible extension to to other immediate reaction infantry battalions is being investigated to determine whether it can be reconciled with the relevant provisions of the accords. The dismantling of a third immediate reaction infantry battalion (Atlacatl) began on 22 September 1992 but was suspended by the Government in late October. It will now be completed by 8 December 1992, subject to the arrangements discussed in paragraph 10 above.;Monitor;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ONUSAL_S/24833;23;485;EDIT: The Military Division is verifying that the reduction of the armed forces called for by the peace accords is being carried out in accordance with the reduction plan submitted by the Government to the Secretary-General [DisarmamentDemobilization: Monitor]. The strength reductions carried out up to late October conformed with that plan. As described in paragraph 9 above, President Cristiani announced on a temporary suspension of implementation of the plan, but this will be restored in early December as a result of the consultations described in paragraph 10 above. The Division's verification, through visits to units and review of relevant documents, has determined that the majority of demobilized personnel were released directly into civilian life, while a number were transferred to non-military service [DisarmamentDemobilization: Monitor., Reintegration: Monitor].

ONUSAL_S/24833;20;482;I have referred in earlier reports to my concern about whether the inventory presented to ONUSAL by FMLN in February 1992 represented a full accounting of FMLN's holding of arms. As part of the second reprogramming, FMLN, after some delays, presented an updated inventory, which is currently being verified by ONUSAL [DisarmamentDemobilization: Monitor].

FMLN attributed the low number of the fact that this first contingent included mainly support personnel who were normally unarmed.

ONUSAL_S/23999;46;472;EDIT:ONUSAL is convinced that the return of judges and mayors and their effective functioning can succeed only in a context of open dialogue between local authorities and the bodies that performed the functions of local government during the armed conflict. Not only will such dialogue guarantee peace and reconciliation in the zones most severely affected by the armed conflict, but it will permit local consultation mechanisms to revive and ensure broad community participation in municipal government, without adversely affecting the institutional framework.

ONUSAL_S/23999;28;467;EDIT: The Government of El Salvador has committed itself to providing premises for the Academy, together with the necessary infrastructure for its operation. The United Nations asked that the Academy should be installed either in the headquarters of the Atlacati Rapid Deployment Infrantry Battalion or in the current Military Academy, which was originally the Academy of public Security and which was taken over by the Army in December 1991. However, after considerable delays, the Government declined to make either of these sites available and suggested a number of alternatives. Of these, the technical mission has chosen the headquarters of the Bracamonte Rapid Deployment Infrantry Batallion, which is to be disbanded under the Peace Agreement. These premises were initially to be made available in late May 1992 but this has been postponed to the end of July 1992. The technical mission has accordingly suggested that the Academy operate provisionally on the premises of the Technical Centre for Police Training, which are to become available in late May, although the latest indications are that it will not be possible to begin tuition until early July. Under this procedure, the Academy would be obliged to reduce the number of recruits from 339 to 270 a month until it can use the Bracamonte premises From then on, the Technical Centre for Police Training premises would be used exclusively for the training of executive and senior officers. FMLN has expressed strong objections to this approach. ONUSAL has urged the Government to ensure that the training of police and personnel at all levels begin simultaneously [PoliceReform: Advocate].

ONUSAL_S/23999;23;464;EDIT: The deployment of police observers throughout the territory of El Salvador began on 7 February 1992. They are currently deployed among six regional offices and four regional sub-offices, from where they monitor National Police activities through visits and day and night patrols [PoliceReform: Monitor., OperationsPatrolsIntervention: Implement], which average 100 daily. In order to ensure that the National Police functions as the sole body responsible for law and order pending the full deployment of the new National Civil Police and to ensure that the transition form one to the other takes place smoothly, the Division lends its support to the police authorities and accompanies police officials and officers as they discharge their duties [PoliceReform: AssistOther].;;;;;;;;;;Assist,Monitor,AssistOther;;Implement;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ONUSAL_S/23999;21;463;The creation of a new police force, completely civilian in its membership and command, is one of the fundamental components of the Peace Agreement.

ONUSAL_S/23999;9;454;By 6 February, which marked the end of the first stage of the separation of forces, the Armed Forces of El Salvador had concentrated its troops at the 100 locations designated in the Peace Agreement. By 22 March, the end of the second stage, the majority of the troops of the Armed Forces of El Salvador had been concentrated at the 62 designated locations. However, at that time the Armed Forces of El Salvador also remained at about 16 additional locations, on the grounds that they were necessary to protect installations of national importance and, at 2 others, on the grounds of lack of space to accommodate all the concentrated personnel. This was not in conformity with the Agreement. ONUSAL accordingly pressed the Armed Forces of El Salvaddor to withdraw and they gradually did so [Demilitarization/DisarmamentDemobilization: Advocate].

ONUCA_S/23421_Honduras;5;449;EDIT: Two of the five Government have since conveyed observations to me on this matter. In a letter dated January 1992, the Chargé d'affaires of the Permanent Mission of Costa Rica to the United Nations stated that while his Government agreed that ONUCA's personnel and equipment should be transferred as quickly as possible to ONUSAL so that the latter could carry out the important new tasks assigned to it. Costa Rica requested that the ONUCA naval squadron, which is contributed by Argentina, should also be transferred to ONUSAL so that it could continue to maintain a watch in the Gulf of Fonseca. Costa Rica also thought it of great importance that ONUSAL should maintain a watch over Honduras' frontier with El Salvador in order to verify compliance with the security undertakings in the Esquipulas II Agreement. On 7 January 1992, the Foreign Minister of Honduras, in a meeting with the Chief Military Observer of ONUCA, expressed his authorities' view that there was still a need for United Nations verification of the Esquipulas II Agreement. He also expressed concern about the possible implications for stability in his country's border areas with El Salvador if certain elements in the latter were not to comply with the agreements reached [Demilitarization: Meeting., BorderControl: Meeting].;;;;Meeting;;;;;;;;;;;;;Meeting;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ONUCA_S/23171_ElSalvador;18;448;EDIT: On 21 August 1991, Salvadorian media reported that a large cache of arms and munitions had been discovered and seized by the Army at San Salvador. On the following day, the ONUCA Observer Group at San Salvador advised the Salvadorian military authorities of its readiness to inspect the arms with a view to establishing their origin, in accordance with ONUCA’s mandate. On 26 August a team of ONUCA observers was given the opportunity to inspect some of these weapons [ControlSALW: Monitor., Demilitarization: Monitor]. As already advised by the Salvadorian Army, the ONUCA team noted that the serial numbers had been obliterated on several of these weapons. The Salvadorian Army also advised the team that some of the weapons, including six ground-to-air missiles of various types, had already been dispatched to a location outside El Salvador for possible identification. So far, ONUCA has not received an official request from the Salvadorian authorities to investigate the origin of any of the weapons in question.;;;Monitor;Monitor;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ONUCA_S/23171_Guatemala;14;446;EDIT: In spite of the reduction in the strength of the ONUCA military observers and air wing, patrolling on land, in the air and at sea since 7 May 1991 has been maintained at or above the levels achieved during the previous six months. Patrols by overland vehicles totalled approximately 270,000 kilometros. The ONUCA's air wing now consists of two fixed-wing aircraft., a Dornier contributed by Germany and a Cessna 404, and four Bell 212 helicopters chartered commercially. The Cessna and the helicopters are used both for patrolling, often with the fast patrol boats, and for the transport of both personnel and cargo. At the request of the Guatemalan authorities, two of the helicopters were dispatched on a special relief mission to Guatemala from 24 to 27 September 1991 for victims of the earthquake that struck that country on 18 September 1991 [HumanitarianRelief MaterialSupport];;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;MaterialSupport;;;;
ONUCA_S/23171_Nicaragua;15;445;EDIT: During the period covered by the present report, ONUCA received only one request for a formal investigation of an alleged violation of the Esquipulas II Agreements. This request, which was received from the Government of El Salvador on 21 May 1991, asked ONUCA to try to establish the origin of ground-to-air missiles of the SAM-16 type reported to be in the possession of the Frente Farsbundo Marti pars la Liberscidn National (FMLN). The Government's request was accompanied by a video cassette on which at least one such missile could be seen in the hands of armed personnel, said to be FMLN combatants. As Nicaragua is the only country in the Central American subregion known to possess SAM-16 missiles, ONUCA requested the Government of Nicaragua to make an inventory of its arsenals so as to establish whether any SAM-16 missile was missing. In response, the Government of Nicaragua informed ONUCA, on 25 June 1991, that it had carried out such an inventory and that all SAM-16 missiles had been accounted for and found to be in their proper locations, On 1 July 1991, a team of ONUCA observers was enabled to inspect and count the firing mechanisms of the SAM-16 missiles and, on 5 July, to count the missiles themselves. [Demilitarization: Monitor] On 31 July, ONUCA observers were also invited to examine a certified protocol setting out the results of an earlier inventory jointly undertaken by officers from Nicaragua and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics.  The verification team found no discrepancy between its own count of the missiles and firing mechanisms on the one hand and the certified protocol on the other. As already reported by ONUCA to the Government of El Salvador and Nicaragua, ONUCA does not expect to be in a position to determine the origin of the SAM-16 missiles mentioned by the Government of El Salvador in its letter of 21 May 1991 unless additional information can be made available concerning possible sources and routes of supply;;;;Monitor;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ONUCA_S/23171_Nicaragua;11;444;EDIT: In trying to prevent illicit activities across its borders, whether originating inside or outside its territory, Nicaragua is faced with special difficulties arising out of the continuing reduction of its armed forces (now reported to number some 21,000), which are at the same time called upon to help restrain mounting internal unrest and violence. ONUCA has noted that some segments of Nicaragua’s long and rugged land borders, as well as portions of its Pacific and Atlantic coast, lack a permanent security presence and would thus seem to be susceptible to violations of the Esquipulas II Agreements [BorderControl: Monitor]. The Chief Military Observer has assured me that the Government of Nicaragua is cogniant of this problem and is making such efforts as the means at its disposal permit.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;Monitor;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ONUCA_S/23171_Honduras;10;443;EDIT: While the re-emergence and apparent expansion of irregular armed groups in Nicaragua is a matter of serious concern for the Nicaraguan Government, there is not, as yet, any confirmed evidence that such groups receive external assistance in violation of the Esquipulas II agreements. In the light of the increasing risk that such violations might occur, Nicaragua’s neighbours have taken steps to increase vigilance on their borders and to improve their capacity to intervene effectively if the need arises. Some measures adopted by Costa Rica are mentioned above. In Honduras, where the Government has expressed concern that the national territory might be used illegally by conflicting forces and has asked ONUCA to act urgently to forestall such a possibility, ONUCA has established an operational patrol post at Danli from which vehicle and helicopter patrols regularly visit various locations near the border [OperationsPatrolsIntervention: Implement., BorderControl: Implement]. The armed forces of Honduras have also strengthened their deployment along the most sensitive portions of the border with Nicaragua and have increased the frequency of patrols. Recently, ONUCA and the Honduran army carried out simultaneous helicopter patrols to investigate the rumoured existence of a camp of armed Nicaraguan irregulars on Honduran territory close to the Nicaraguan horder [OperationsPatrolsIntervention: Assist., BorderControl: Assist]. No evidence was found to corroborate these rumours. As regards Honduras border with El Salvador, ONUCA has noted intensified patrolling by the Honduran armed forces [OperationsPatrolsIntervention: Monitor., BorderControl: Monitor], both on land and in the air, in the wake of incidents over the past several months. The ONUCA operational patrol post at La Esperanaa was moved to Marcala in August 1991 to provide easier access to some of the more sensitive points on that border;;;;;;;;;;;;Monitor,Assist,Implement;;;;;Monitor,Implement,Assist;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ONUCA_S/23171;19;440;EDIT: ONUCA has continued to carry out informal investigations and inspections in connection with border incidents throughout the region [BorderControl: Monitor]. For example, ONUCA teams were dispatched to Colomoncagua and Mapulaca in Honduras, close to the border with El Salvador, on 27 and 29 July 1991 respectively, to look into separate border incidents which, in both cases, had led to casualties among civilians . ONUCA found no evidence to suggest that motives other than criminal ones had been behind these incidents.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;Monitor;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ONUCA_S/23171;14;439;EDIT: In spite of the reduction in the strength of the ONUCA military observers and air wing, patrolling on land, in the air and at sea since 7 May 1991 has been maintained at or above the levels achieved during the previous six months. Patrols by overland vehicles totalled approximately 270,000 kilometros [OperationsPatrolsIntervention: Implement]. The ONUCA's air wing now consists of two fixed-wing aircraft., a Dornier contributed by Germany and a Cessna 404, and four Bell 212 helicopters chartered commercially. The Cessna and the helicopters are used both for patrolling, often with the fast patrol boats, and for the transport of both personnel and cargo. At the request of the Guatemalan authorities, two of the helicopters were dispatched on a special relief mission to Guatemala from 24 to 27 September 1991 for victims of the earthquake that struck that country on 18 September 1991.;;;;;;;;;;;;Implement;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ONUCA_S/23171;8;438;EDIT: ONUCA has also continued to patrol sensitive border areas where violations of the Esquipulas II Agreements are most likely to occur [OperationsPatrolsIntervention: Implement., BorderControl: Implement]. On the basis of its observations and its contacts with the national armies and security authorities, OUNCA has been able to assess the adequacy of security arrangements in various border zones [BorderControl: Monitor]. In this regard, the Chief Military Observer has established that efforts are being made by the five Central American Governments and their armies and security authorities to honour their commitments under Esquipulas I I. At the same time, however, it has become clear to ONUCA that for a variety of reasons, the most important of which are discussed below, breaches of those commitments continues to occur;;;;;;;;;;;;Implement;;;;;Monitor,Implement;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ONUCA_S/23171;7;437;EDIT: In line with the conclusions set out in my report of 29 April 1991 (S/22543, para. 25 and 261) ONUCA's activities over the past six months have been focused, more directly than in the past, on liaison and contacts with the armed forces and other security authorities of the five Central American Governments. To that effect, ONUCA has increased its visits to, and intensified the exchange of information with, national armies and security authorities, both in the field and in the five capitals [MilitaryReform: Meeting]. It will be recalled that that ONUCA was established to verify the five Central American Governments’ compliance with two specific security commitments into which they had entered under the Esquipulas II Agreements, i.e.. the termination of aid to irregular forces and insurrectionist movements and the non-use of the territory of one State for attacks on another State in the region. The added emphasis now being placed on close contacts with national authorities responsible for border control and security is, designed to enhance ONUCA’s capacity to fulfil that mandate, This shift of emphasis reflects the fact that ONUCA’s role is limited to verifying that each of the five Government's complies with its undertakings, whereas full responsibility for detecting and preventing activities which would violate the two commitments rests with the five Governments themselves;;;;;;;;;;;Meeting;;;;;;Monitor,Meeting;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ONUCA_S/22543_Honduras;18;436;EDIT: In the early afternoon of 2 April 1991, ONUCA was informed by the Government of Honduras that a group of Salvadorian soldiers and customs officials had crossed into Honduran territory from the Salvadorian customs post at El Poy, following an attack by FMLN on that post several hours earlier. At the Government’s request, a team composed of military observers from the verification centres at Santa Rosa de Copán and Esquipulas arrived at El Poy later in the afternoon. By that time the FMLN elements had withdrawn from the border posts and departed from El Poy. The team was shown two dead Salvadorian soldiers and extensive damage to the Salvadorian customs post [OperationsUseofForce: Monitor].;;;;;;;;;;;;;Monitor;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ONUCA_S/22543_Nicaragua;16;434;EDIT: Thirdly, on 11 March 1991, following the interception by the Honduran Army of a truck loaded with arms and other war matérial near the Honduran-Nicaraguan border on 22 February 1991, the Honduran Government asked ONUCA to investigate the origin of the matérial. In response, ONUCA obtained from the Government of Nicaragua information on the latter’s own investigation, which indicated that the matérial might have been shipped illegally to Honduras with the assistance of Nicaraguan Army personnel. ONUCA’s report on this matter, which will be completed as soon as additional information requested from the Nicaraguan authorities is received, will be made available to the Governments concerned, in accordance with established procedure [Demilitarization: Monitor];;;;Monitor;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

ONUCA_S/22543_Nicaragua;14;431;EDIT: During the period covered by the present report, ONUCA received three requests to investigate alleged violations of the Esquipulas II undertakings. The first of these was received on 7 January 1991 from the Government of El Salvador, which asked ONUCA to investigate the origin of SAM-7 and SAM-14 ground-to-air missiles apparently used by the Frente Farabundo Marti para la Liberation National (FMLN) in El Salvador, particularly in the Department of Usulután on 23 November 1990. The Government of Nicaragua extended its full cooperation to ONUCA and confirmed that the missiles in question had been illicitly removed from Nicaraguan army arsenals with the assistance of some army officers and had been handed over to FMLN in October 1990. As was subsequently reported in the press, 17 of these missiles were returned by FMLN to the Government of Nicaragua on 2 February 1991., a further 11 were said to have been fired by FMLN.

It also helped the Honduran health authorities in the vaccination and feeding of children in otherwise inaccessible areas. Further, at the request of the Government of Costa Rica, six members of the ONUCA medical team were dispatched to that country on 23 April 1991 to provide emergency medical services to the victims of the earthquake that struck the eastern sectors of Costa Rica and Panama on 22 April [HumanitarianRelief: Assist].

ONUCA_S/22543_Honduras;11;427;"EDIT: The WC in San Lorenzo, Honduras, continues to patrol the Gulf of Fonseca and adjacent waters in the Pacific Ocean [Operations_PatrolsInterventions: Implement]. Whereas patrolling was initially limited to daylight hours, night patrols were introduced in the last quarter of 1990 and now account for more than one third of the total. As a further
refinement, joint patrolling with helicopters was initiated in October 1990. Since then more than 30 joint patrols, involving over 50 helicopter flying hours, have been carried out. From helicopters working in coordination with the NVC, ONUCA observers help to guide fast patrol boats to vessels that seem to warrant ONUCA's attention. The database that is being compiled by the NVC enables ONUCA to identify divergences from established patterns of traffic that could suggest possible violations of the Esquipulas II undertakings [Demilitarization: Monitor].";;;;Monitor;;;;;;;;Implement;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ONUCA_S/22543_Honduras;9;426;"EDIT: Although patrolling by land declined from a total of some 450,000 kilometres in the period May-November 1990 to just over
250,000 kilometres in the past six months, that patrolling has been focused on a smaller area than before. Its intensity in the border zones where it is now concentrated has been maintained at the earlier level and in some cases increased, Conversely, and notwithstanding the reduction of the helicopter
wing from 12 to 6 aircraft, patrolling by helicopter increased from 570 hours in the period May-October 1990 to more than 700 hours during the past 6 months. During the same period the naval unit in San Lorenzo carried out over 1,800 hours of patrolling, including more than 750 hours of night patrols, and covered 17,000 nautical miles [Operations_PatrolsInterventions: Implement].";;;;;;;;;;;;Implement;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ONUCA_S/22543;24;422;"EDIT: During the course of the mandate period that is about to end, I instructed that a study be undertaken into the cost-effectiveness of ONUCA's current method of operation. The study was to take into account the relevant recommendations made to the Central American Presidents by their Security Commission at its meeting at Tegecigalpa on 23 and 24 November 1990. These recommendations were, inter alia, that further efforts should be exerted by all concerned to improve liaison and the exchange of information between ONUCA and the five governments, that ONUCA should improve its communications systems and, if necessary, acquire additional equipment, such as modern communications and radar installations, and that ONUCA should increase its presence and verification activity along national boundaries in the region. The study was also to take into account the fact that as report in paragraph 10 above, ONUCA's extensive patrolling activities had not so far led to the detection of a single violation of the Esquipulas II undertakings [OperationsPatrolsIntervention: Implement] . This raised the question of whether, bearing in mind the Security Council reference in paragraph 2 of resolution 675 to ""the need to continue to monitor expenditure carefully during this period of increasing demands on peace-keeping resources"" such patrolling was cost-effective.";;;;;;;;;;;;;Implement;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ONUCA_S/22543;23;421;EDIT: I remain convinced that ONUCA continues to make a valuable contribution to the peace process in Central America by providing an impartial mechanism for verifying that the five Central American Governments are complying with the security undertakings in the Esquipulas II Agreements [Demilitarization: Monitor]. It is gratifying that the five Presidents themselves, in the joint declaration issued at the end of their summit at Puntarenas, Costa Rica, from 15 to 17 December 1990, expressed their full confidence in ONUCA. At the same time, important to re-emphasize the point made in paragraph 27 of my report of 26 October 1990 (S/21909), namely that ONUCA is not mandated, staffed or equipped to detect clandestine activities or take physical action to prevent them. Those functions properly belong to the five Governments, which agreed at Esquipulas to cease aid to irregular forces and insurrectionist movements and to prevent the use of one State's territory for attacks on others.;;;;Monitor;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ONUCA_S/22543;10;420;"EDIT: In spite of this intensity of patrolling on land, in the air and at sea, ONUCA did not observe directly any specific violation of the security undertakings [Operations_PatrolsInterventions: Implement., BorderControl: Implement, Monitor., Demilitarization: Monitor]. It noted, however, that the presence of national army and security personnel in some sensitive border areas did not always appear to be sufficient to enable the Governments concerned to comply with those
undertakings [Demilitarization: Monitor., BorderControl: Monitor]. Indeed, during the past six months, ONUCA observers have
discerned a tendency to reduce the presence of national army and security forces in certain areas where violations of the undertakings might have occurred in the past and might still be taking place. In some areas, national
officials and local residents have told ONUCA of cross-border traffic of an undetermined nature by armed persons. ONUCA has encountered no direct evidence, however, that these movements are such as to constitute violations of the undertakings [Demilitarization: Monitor, BorderControl: Monitor]. Instead, ONUCA has often been told by national
authorities that such incidents are essentially of a criminal character .";Monitor;;;;;;;;;;;Implement;;;;;Monitor,Implement;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

ONUCA_S/22543;8;418;"EDIT: In my report of 26 October 1990 (S/21909), I proposed the closure of some of ONUCA's verification centres and a reduction of some 40 per cent in its military strength following the termination of hostilities in Nicaragua in the
first half of 1990. At the same time I confirmed that I was convinced of the continuing validity of ONUCA's mandate, as defined by the Security Council in its resolution 644 (1989) of 7 November 1989. This mandate entrusts ONUCA with responsibility for verifying compliance by the five Central American
Governments with the security undertakings in the Esquipulas II Accords concerning the cessation of aid to irregular forces and insurrectionist movements active in the region and the prevention of the use of the territory
of one State for attacks on any of the other States.

ONUCA_S/21931_Nicaragua;17;414;"In my report of 4 June 1990 (S/21341), I informed the Council about a set of
complaints investigated by ONUCA referring to the situation surrounding the
security zones and the demilitarized zones in Nicaragua [Demilitarization: Monitor]. In general, it remained
my assessment that there had not been serious violations of the cease-fire. Some
breaches of the agreement on the separation of forces in certain areas were
attributable to the lack of trust between the two sides following eight years of
hostilities. As far as demobilization was concerned, I noted that, although there
had recently been a welcome increase in its rate, the leaders of the Nicaraguan
resistance had still not achieved the minimum target to which they had committed
themselves. In a further report to the Security Council on 8 June (S/21349), I
recommended that ONUCA’s mandate of monitoring the cease-fire and separation of
forces in Nicaragua and demobilizing members of the Nicaraguan resistance be
extended, on the understanding that these tasks would lapse with the completion of
the demobilization process not later than 29 June 1990 (resolution 656 (1990)).";;;;Monitor;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

This raised the total strength of the air wing to 1 fixed-wing aircraft and 16 helicopters. While demobilization was in progress, eight of ONUCA’s helicopters operated as a
separate detachment in Managua, At the end of June the air wing returned to its previous strength of 1 fixed-wing aircraft and 12 helicopters. Over the past six months the fixed-wing aircraft has flown a total of some 845 hours (including one medical evacuation to Miami and another to Panama City), while the helicopters have logged approximately 5,230 flying hours. On 27 June 1990, ONUCA personnel were able to render immediate assistance when two helicopters of the Nicaraguan air force collided at San Pedro de Lovago at the end of a ceremony marking the demobilization of the leaders of the Nicaraguan Resistance.

Patrolling is again being carried out, on a daily basis, by land, air and sea as well as, occasionally, by river. During the last six months patrols by land vehicles have covered some 458,300 km, while patrolling by helicopter has totalled some 570 flying hours. Since it became operational on 29 June 1990, the naval unit at San Lorenzo has carried out 1,180 hours of patrolling [OperationsPatrolsIntervention: Implement]. In spite of such intensive patrolling, however, no violations of the Esquipulas II security undertakings were detected by the military observers of ONUCA.

most likely to occur [Demilitarization: Monitor]. Through frequent patrolling of these areas, by vehicle, horse, helicopter and boat as appropriate, ONUCA acquaints itself with the people and the governmental authorities at the local level [Operations_PatrolsInterventions: Implement]. It becomes familiar with the normal pattern of activity in the areas concerned and improves its ability to notice departures from the pattern, which could indicate that violations of the security undertakings were taking place.

perform the preventive or deterrent function referred to in paragraph 8 of my report of 11 October 1989 (S/20895).

Patrolling is again being carried out, on a daily basis, by land, air and sea as well as, occasionally, by river [Operations_PatrolsInterventions: Implement, BorderControl: Monitor]. During the last six months patrols by land vehicles have covered some 458,300 km, while patrolling by helicopter has totalled some 570 flying hours. Since it became operational on 29 June 1990, the naval unit at San Lorenzo has carried out 1,180 hours of patrolling. In spite of such intensive patrolling, however, no violations of the Esquipulas II security undertakings were detected by the military observers of ONUCA [Demilitarization: Monitor]. In this connection, the difficult geographic and climatic conditions, which for a while seriously curtailed flying hours and rendered most secondary roads impassable, continued to have a negative impact on ONUCA’s ability to carry out its mandate.;;;;Monitor;;;;;;;;Implement;;;;;Monitor;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ONUCA_S/21909;13;389;"EDIT: The demobilization operation required substantial changes in the deployment of
ONUCA’s military observers from the middle of April until the end of June 1990. During the peak period of the operation, some 122 observers, or 48 per cent of a total strength of 255 observers, were deployed in Nicaragua to perform tasks connected with the demobilisation. Regular patrolling and other activities relating to ONUCA’s original mandate had to be significantly reduced during this period as a consequence of this temporary redeployment of manpower to Nicaragua [Operations_PatrolsInterventions: Implement].";;;;;;;;;;;;Implement;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ONUCA_S/21379_Nicaragua;8;387;"EDIT: As regards surface-to-air missiles, 84 ""Redeye"" and 28 ""Sam-7"" missiles were handed over to ONUCA [DisarmamentDemobilization: Implement]. On the basis of consultations with various parties who might be in a position to form an estimate of the number of such weapons in the possession of the Nicaraguan Resistance at the time that demobilization began, these figures approximate closely what was expected. As reported above, the commander of all the fronts have solemnly assured ONUCA, both orally and in writing, that no arms or military equipment remain under their command or have been hidden.";Implement;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ONUCA_S/21379_Nicaragua;6;386;EDIT: Annex III to the present report sets out totals for the different categories of weapons that were handed over by the members of the Nicaraguan Resistance in Honduras and Nicaragua respectively, up to and including 28 June 1990. These were destroyed on the spot by ONUCA [DisarmamentDemobilization: Implement], as agreed. ONUCA was informed both by senior officers of the Nicaraguan Army and by the leaders of the Nicaraguan Resistance themselves that the Resistance had always been a lightly armed and mobile force that hardly ever deployed heavy weapons inside Nicaragua. ONUCA nevertheless paid special attention to two categories of heavy weapons that were reported to be in the possession of the Nicaraguan Resistance, namely heavy machine-guns and surface-to-air missiles.;Implement;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ONUCA_S/21379_Nicaragua;4;385;EDIT: As regards Nicaragua, demobilization in that country began on 8 May 1990 but proceeded slowly until the signature of the Managua Protocol on 30 May 1990. Eight security zones were established for the purpose, zone 1 to 5 being for the members of the Northern and Central Fronts, zones 6 and 7 for the Atlantic Front and zone 8 for the Southern Front. The senior commanders of the Nicaraguan Resistance, together with members of their staff, travelled from zone 5 to the village of San pedro do Lovago on 27 June 1990 and were demobilized there by ONUCA [DisarmamentDemobilization: Implement] on the same day in a final ceremony attended by the President of Nicaragua, members of her Government and the Archbishop of Managua. A temporary demobilization post was established at El Cedro on 20 June 1990 when ONUCA was made aware of the presence of some stragglers who had not reported to the security zones in that area before they were closed., demobilization continued there up to 28 June 1990. In addition, 15 members of the Nicaraguan Resistance reported for demobilization to the ONUCA verification centre at Estelí. The totals of armed and unarmed members of the Nicaraguan Resistance who were demobilized at each of the above locations are set out in annex II to the present report.;Implement;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ONUCA_S/21349_Nicaragua;4;383;"EDIT: The second group are the members of the Nicaraguan resistance belonging to the
“Atlantic Front” (Yatama) who are present in security zones 6 and 7 (see S/21274/Add.l, para. 7) and whose demobilization started on 21 May. Their demobilization has proceeded at a less satisfactory pace than that of the main
group, largely because of logistic difficulties in concentrating them at demobilization areas in the large security zones concerned. As of 7 June, 305 members of this group had been demobilized. ONUCA estimates that at least
another 1,000 are yet to be demobilized [DisarmamentDemobilization: Monitor].";Monitor;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ONUCA_S/21349_Nicaragua;3;382;"EDIT: The first and largest group consists of the combatants of the “Northern Front”
and “Central Front” who have concentrated in security zones 1 to 5 (see S/21274/Add.l, para. 2) and whose demobilization has been the subject of several agreements with the Nicaraguan Government, culminating in the Managua Protocol of 30 May (see S/21341, annex). Since my report of 4 June, there has been a further marked increase in the rate at which this group is being demobilized. In the four days from 4 to 7 June inclusive, the daily rate of demobilization has averaged 703. The Chief Military Observer of ONUCA has reported that the average age of demobilized personnel is around 25, with most of them very close to that age [DisarmamentDemobilization: Monitor]. He has also reported that the weapons handed in can be described, with few exceptions, as being in generally serviceable condition [DisarmamentDemobilization: Implement]. As of 7 June, 6,536 members of this group had been demobilized since the process began in Nicaragua on 8 May. ONUCA' s estimate is that approximately 6,700 remain to be demobilized including several
thousand unarmed support personnel. It has been informed by the leadership of the Nicaraguan resistance in the area that a major ceremony will take place on 9 June
in security zone 5 at which 2,000 or more combatants will hand over their weapons
etc., to ONUCA.";Implement,Monitor;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ONUCA_S/21341_Nicaragua;9;381;EDIT: On the day the Managua Protocol was Signed, 30 May, there was a marked increase in the pace of demobilisation, with 498 members of the Nicaraguan resistance being demobilized. In the five days since the Protocol was signed, namely 30 May to 3 June inclusive, the number demobilised in sone 1 to 5 has averaged 377 daily, bringing to 3,726 the total demobilised in those sones since the process began on 8 May. ONUCA’s estimate, as of 3 June, is that approximately 9,800 members of the Nicaraguan resistance covered by the Managua Protocol remain to be demobilised [DisarmamentDemobilization: Monitor]. This total excludes the members of the Atlantic Front of the Nicaraguan resistance (YATAMA), whose demobilisation, which is covered under a separate agreement, started on 21 May. So far 107 members of YATAMA have been demobilised. In addition, it should be noted that a branch of the Nicaraguan resistance known as the Southern Front (mte SW), which claims to have as many as 2,000 combatants under arms outside the security sones, has so far failed to sign an agreement to demobilise. Negotiations in Managua between Government representatives and leaders of the Southern Front broke down on 22 May and have not as yet been resumed.;Monitor;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ONUCA_S/21341_Nicaragua;8;380;EDIT: It will be noted that paragraph 5 (a) of the Managua Protocol refers to an enlargement of the mandate of ONUCA. I have not as yet received any communication in this respect from the Government of Nicaragua. However, I have been informed by the Chief Military Observer that at the meeting on 29130 May the representatives of the Nicaraguan resistance proposed that ONUCA should be given the additional tasks of collecting weapons that might remain in civilian hands in Nicaragua, training a new national police force and verifying the proposed reduction in the strength of the Nicaraguan army [ControlSALW: Meeting with IA., PoliceReform: Meeting with IA., MilitaryReform: Meeting with IA* based on previous paragraph]. I have, of course, instructed the Chief Military Observer to make clear to all concerned that any matter having to do with ONUCA’s mandate will fall within the responsibility of the Security Council, which would have to approve any modification or further enlargement of the mandate. I have also instructed him to indicate that the members of the Council alone could decide whether or not ONUCA should be involved in such tasks and that they have already expressed their concern at the delay in implementing existing agreements on whose basis they have twice enlarged ONUCA’s mandate.;;;Meeting,InternationalActor;;;;;;;Meeting,InternationalActor;Meeting,InternationalActor;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ONUCA_S/21341_Nicaragua;7;379;"EDIT: On the night of 29/30 May an important meeting took place between President Chsmorro of Nicaragua, “Commander Franklyn” of the Nicaraguan resistance
and the Archbishop of Managua, Cardinal Obando y Bravo, with the Chief Military
Observer of ONUCA and representatives of CIAV being present aa observers. The meeting resulted in an agreement entitled the “Managua Protocol*‘, the text of which is attached as an annex to the present report. Under the terms of the Managua Protocol, the Nicaraguan Government responded to a number of the resistance’s publicly stated concerns, notably through the establishment of “development areas” (polosrdesarrollp) in which demobilised members of the resistance would be resettled [Reintegration: Meeting with IA]., economic assistance to former members of the resistance., the creation of a police force for the development areas in which former members of the resistance would participate [PoliceReform: Meeting with IA., Reintegration: Meeting with IA]., various security measures and full implementation of the Managua Agreements [Demilitarization: Meeting., DisarmamentDemobilization: Meeting]. For its part, the resistance reaffirmed its commitment to demobilise by 10 June 1990 at the latest and, to this end, undertook that at least 100 combatants would be demobilised each day in each of the security zones.";Meeting,InternationalActor;Meeting,InternationalActor;;Meeting,InternationalActor;;;;;;Meeting,InternationalActor;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ONUCA_S/21341_Nicaragua;6;378;"EDIT: The following day, 26 May, a joint investigation commission consisting of representatives of the Nicaraguan Government, the Nicaraguan resistance, the Archbishop ot Managua, ONUCA and the International Support and Verification Commission (CIAV) was set up by the Government to investigate the alleged
massacre. On 2 June the Chief Military Observer reported to me that in its final report issued on 30 May the Joint Commission had in effect concluded that there was no evidence to support the allegation that a massacre had taken place [MilitaryReform: Monitor, AssistOther with IA].

*based on information in paragraph 5 of the report: ""However, implementation of the Managua Agreements encountered a setback on 25 May when the leadership of the Nicaraguan resistance issued a statement in which it alleged that the Nicaraguan authorities had failed to carry out their commitments under the Agreements and complained about an alleged attack carried out one week before by Nicaraguan army troops against a large number of demobilised members of the resistance and their families, in which many were said to have been killed or injured.

ONUCA_S/21341_Nicaragua;3;376;"EDIT: On my express instructions, the Chief Military Observer took urgent action during the following days to investigate all the complaints received [Demilitarization : Monitor]. By 30 May almost all of them had been resolved by ONUCA through negotiation at the highest level with the Nicaraguan authorities on the one hand and the Nicaraguan resistance on the other [Demilitarization: Meeting]. The few complaints which remain unresolved arise mostly from cases where there is a difference of opinion between the two sides about the precise boundaries of the security sones and the demilitarised sones.

*coded based on information in paragraph 2 of the report: ""On 25 May 1990 I received from the Chief Military Observer a list of complaints which had earlier been presented to ONUCA by the leadership of the Nicaraguan resistance alleging violations of the Managua Agreements of 18 April (S/21272) by the Nicaraguan army. Most of these complaints related to the continuing presence of armed civilians and militia personnel in security sones 2 and 5 and in the demilitarised sones surrounding security sones 1, 2 and 5. But they also referred to the alleged presence of units Of the Nicaraguan army at eight locations in the demilitarised zone surrounding security sone 1. ONUCA had also received complaints from the Nicaraguan Government about the presence outside the security sones of armed members of the Nicaraguan resistance who had allegedly stolen cattle and committed other criminal acts.""";;;;Monitor,Meeting;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ONUCA_S/21274/Add.1_Nicaragua;10;375;EDIT: The agreement signed at Managua on 18-19 April provided that the voluntary demobilisation of the members of the Nicaraguan resistance deployed inside Nicaragua would commence on 25 April and be completed at the latest by 10 June 1990. Whereas all the necessary arrangements had been made by ONUCA, in coordination with representatives of the Nicaraguan resistance, for demobilisation to begin in zone 1 at 1500 hours on 25 April [Demobilization: Assist] , those members of the resistance who had assembled there for this purposed declines to lay down their weapons after listening to a declaration by their commander atating this view that the minimum condition for demobilization had not been met. Representatives of the Government of Nicaragua and of Cardinal Obando y Bravo were also present on this occasion and addressed the members of the Nicaraguan resistance, urging them to proceed with the demobilization. Subsequently, the commander of the Nicaraguan resistance concerned requested a meeting at Managua with representatives of the Government in order to discuss the start of demobilization. At the time of writing, it was envisaged that such a meeting might be held at Managua in the coming days. Meanwhile, ONUCA remains ready to carry out its responsibilities in connection with the demobilization as soon as it gets under way.;Assist;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ONUCA_S/21274/Add.1_Nicaragua;9;374;"In accordance with the terms of the cease-fire agreement, Nicaraguan
Government forces were withdrawn to positions outside the “demilitarized zones”
during the period 19-21 April, having disarmed Nicaraguan militia units which were present in <he zones. As a result of this and the accompanying concentration of
the members of the Nicaraguan resistance within the “security zones”, a separation
of forces is being achieved. Few problems have occurred in connection with the
establishment of the separation of forces, which is closely monitored by ONUCA [Demilitarization: Monitor].

ONUCA observer teams were dispatched to each “security zone” to investigate
immediately, should the need arise, any breaches of the cease-fire, and to carry
out road and helicopter patrols within the zones as a confidence-building measure [Opeartions_PatrolsInterventions: Implement]. While some minor incidents have occurred since the cease-fire came into effect, neither Nicaraguan party has reported incidents which have subsequently been

maintained informal contacts with the principal irregular forces and insurrectionist movements in the region, namely the Nicaraguan resistance and the Frente Farabundo Marti para la Liberation National (FMLN) of El Salvador, The purpose of these contacts has been to seek the two groups’ co-operation in
facilitating the implementation of ONUCA’s mandate and to ensure that no threat is
presented by either of them to the security of ONUCA personnel. Both groups have
expressed reservations about ONUCA’s original mandate, which they see as being
Ciracted against their interests. In the case of the Nicaraguan resistance it was only in early March that ONUCA began to obtain access to their camps in Honduras. This problem was, however, resolved after agreement was reached on the voluntary demobilization of the members of the Nicaraguan resistance. For its part, FLMN has assured the Chief Military Observer that all its personnel have received orders not to undertake any hostile action against ONUCA verification centres or patrols and has suggested certain steps which ONUCA can take (and has taken) to reduce the risk of accidental confrontations.

That company arrived in Honduras on 10 April 1990. On 16 April it demobilized 260 members of the Atlantic Front (Yatama) of the Nicaraguan resistance at La Kiatara in eastern Honduras and destroyed their weapons and military equipment. At their summit at Montelinlar, Nicaragua, on 3 April 1990, the five Central American Presidents had agreed to my proposal that the weapons and other equipment received from the members of the Nicaraguan resistance should be destroyed by ONUCA. On 18 April, at the main
Nicaraguan resistance camp at Yamales in Honduras, large quantities of weapons, most of them obsolete and unserviceable, were handed over to ONUCA for destruction [ControlSALW: Implement].

In each case the complaint was communicated to the Government complained against, which was asked to extend to ONUCA the co-operation needed to enable it to investigate the complaint, The details are as follows: (a) On 18 January 1990, the Chief Military Observer received a letter from the Nicaraguan authorities complaining about the alleged presence of members of the Nicaraguan resistance on Costa Rican territory close to the border between the two countries on 12 and 14 January 1990. The Nicaraguan authorities also addressed this complaint directly to the Costa Rican authorities which, having carried out
their own investigation, informed ONUCA that no evidence had been found to substantiate the Nicaraguan complaint and that the Joint Border Commission set up by the two countries was continuing to function well. (b) On 15 March 1990 the Chief Military Observer received a letter from the Salvadorian authorities alleging the presence on Nicaraguan territory of: (i) A radio transmitter used for military purposes by FMLNJ

Patrolling has been carried out daily by land and air and occasionally by river [Operations_PatrolsInterventions: Implement]. It has been concentrated in those areas where activities that may be contrary to the security undertakings in the Esquipulaa II Agreement are most frequently alleged to occur. These are the areas adjacent to the borders between Costa Rica and Nicaragua, between Honduras and Nicaragua, between Honduras and El Salvador and between Guatemala and El Salvador, together with the north-eastern part of Nicaragua and the south-western part of Honduras [BorderControl: Implement (areas where ONUCA patrols)]. ONUCA’s patrols have confirmed that in many of these areas the nature of the terrain is such that it is very difficult for the local authorities to prevent, and for international observers to detect, clandestine movement of armed personnel and military supplies across the borders. Vegetation is dense, metalled roads are few and far between, earth roads become impassable during the rainy season and many of the border areas are believed to be mined. While specific breaches of the security undertakings in the Esquipulas II Agreement have not been directly observed by ONUCA patrols [BorderControl: Monitor, Operations_PatrolsInterventions: Implement], cross-border movements have undoubtedly taken place during the period under review, especially a major movement of members of the Nicaraguan resistance from Honduras into Nicaragua during March and early April.;;;;;;;;;;;;Implement;;;;;Monitor,Implement;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
